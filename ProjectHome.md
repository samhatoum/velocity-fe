Velocity allows skins to be PURE Flash, intended to work on ANY platform, and to allow plug ins to be coded in ANY language.

Skins are Flash swf movies with all the animation, sounds and everything you see in Flash presentations, without having to rely at all on any structure or restrictions imposed by the front end.

Flash communicates with a Java server. This Java server contains plug ins, and these plug ins can be written without any knowledge of the user interface. The plugin's methods are all delegated, and the properties are all synchronised between Java and Flash via the Velocity framework.

Non Java plug ins, which would probably be platform specific, communicate with the framework through XML via network sockets.
