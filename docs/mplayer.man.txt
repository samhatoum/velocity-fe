DESCRIPTION
       mplayer is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other  platforms  and
       CPU  architectures,  see  the  documentation).  It plays most MPEG/VOB,
       AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo,
       yuv4mpeg,  FILM  and  RoQ  files,  supported  by many native and binary
       codecs.  You can watch Video CD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5  and  even
       WMV movies, too.

       MPlayer  supports  a  wide range of video and audio output drivers.  It
       works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,  AAlib,  libcaca,  Di‐
       rectFB,  Quartz, Mac OS X CoreVideo, but you can also use GGI, SDL (and
       all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA-compatible card,  even  without
       X11),  some  low-level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3dfx and ATI)
       and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens  DVB,  Haup‐
       pauge PVR (IVTV), DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.  Most of them support soft‐
       ware or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen mode.

       MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice  big
       antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
       European/ISO8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Ko‐
       rean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, Sub‐
       Rip, OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS  and
       our  own: MPsub) and DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed Cap‐
       tions).

       mencoder (MPlayer’s Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder,  designed
       to encode MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable
       formats (see below).  It encodes to  MPEG-4  (DivX/Xvid),  one  of  the
       libavcodec  codecs  and PCM/MP3/VBRMP3 audio in 1, 2 or 3 passes.  Fur‐
       thermore it has stream copying  abilities,  a  powerful  filter  system
       (crop, expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, RGB/YUV conver‐
       sion) and more.

       gmplayer is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.  It has  the  same
       options as MPlayer.

       Usage  examples  to  get you started quickly can be found at the end of
       this man page.

       Also see the HTML documentation!

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       MPlayer has a fully configurable, command-driven  control  layer  which
       allows you to control MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick or remote
       control (with LIRC).  See the -input option for ways to customize it.

USAGE
       Every ’flag’ option has a ’noflag’ counterpart, e.g.  the  opposite  of
       the -fs option is -nofs.

       If  an option is marked as (XXX only), it will only work in combination
       with the XXX option or if XXX is compiled in.

       NOTE: The suboption parser (used for example for  -ao  pcm  suboptions)
       supports a special kind of string-escaping intended for use with exter‐
       nal GUIs.
       It has the following format:
       %n%string_of_length_n
       EXAMPLES:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%10%C:test.wav test.avi
       Or in a script:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%‘expr length "$NAME"‘%"$NAME" test.avi


CONFIGURATION FILES
       You can put all of the options in configuration  files  which  will  be
       read every time MPlayer/MEncoder is run.  The system-wide configuration
       file ’mplayer.conf’ is in  your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  /etc/
       mplayer or /usr/local/etc/mplayer), the user specific one is ’~/.mplay‐
       er/config’.  The configuration file for MEncoder is ’mencoder.conf’  in
       your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  /etc/mplayer  or /usr/local/etc/
       mplayer), the user specific  one  is  ’~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf.   User
       specific  options override system-wide options and options given on the
       command line override either.  The syntax of the configuration files is
       ’option=<value>’,  everything after a ’#’ is considered a comment.  Op‐
       tions that work without values can be enabled by setting them to  ’yes’
       or  ’1’  or  ’true’  and  disabled  by  setting  them to ’no’ or ’0’ or
       ’false’.  Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

       You can also write file-specific configuration files.  If you  wish  to
       have  a configuration file for a file called ’movie.avi’, create a file
       named ’movie.avi.conf’ with the file-specific options in it and put  it
       in  ~/.mplayer/.   You  can also put the configuration file in the same
       directory as the file to be played, as  long  as  you  give  the  -use-
       filedir-conf  option (either on the command line or in your global con‐
       fig file).

       EXAMPLE MPLAYER CONFIGURATION FILE:

       # Use Matrox driver by default.
       vo=xmga
       # I love practicing handstands while watching videos.
       flip=yes
       # Decode/encode multiple files from PNG,
       # start with mf://filemask
       mf=type=png:fps=25
       # Eerie negative images are cool.
       vf=eq2=1.0:-0.8

       EXAMPLE MENCODER CONFIGURATION FILE:

       # Make MEncoder output to a default filename.
       o=encoded.avi
       # The next 4 lines allow mencoder tv:// to start capturing immediately.
       oac=pcm=yes
       ovc=lavc=yes
       lavcopts=vcodec=mjpeg
       tv=driver=v4l2:input=1:width=768:height=576:device=/dev/video0:audiorate=48000
       # more complex default encoding option set
       lavcopts=vcodec=mpeg4:autoaspect=1
       lameopts=aq=2:vbr=4
       ovc=lavc=1
       oac=lavc=1
       passlogfile=pass1stats.log
       noautoexpand=1
       subfont-autoscale=3
       subfont-osd-scale=6
       subfont-text-scale=4
       subalign=2
       subpos=96
       spuaa=20

PROFILES
       To ease working with different configurations profiles can  be  defined
       in  the  configuration  files.   A profile starts with its name between
       square brackets, e.g. ’[my-profile]’.  All following  options  will  be
       part of the profile.  A description (shown by -profile help) can be de‐
       fined with the profile-desc option.  To end the profile, start  another
       one  or use the profile name ’default’ to continue with normal options.

       EXAMPLE MENCODER PROFILE:


       [mpeg4]
       profile-desc="MPEG4 encoding"
       ovc=lacv=yes
       lavcopts=vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=1200

       [mpeg4-hq]
       profile-desc="HQ MPEG4 encoding"
       profile=mpeg4
       lavcopts=mbd=2:trell=yes:v4mv=yes

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -codecs-file <filename> (also see -afm, -ac, -vfm, -vc)
              Override the standard search path and use the specified file in‐
              stead of the builtin codecs.conf.

       -include <configuration file>
              Specify  configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.

       -list-options
              Prints all available options.

       -msgcharset <charset>
              Convert console messages to the  specified  character  set  (de‐
              fault: autodetect).  Text will be in the encoding specified with
              the --charset configure option.  Set this to "noconv" to disable
              conversion (for e.g. iconv problems).
              NOTE:  The  option  takes  effect after command line parsing has
              finished.  The MPLAYER_CHARSET environment variable can help you
              get rid of the first lines of garbled output.

       -msglevel <all=<level>:<module>=<level>:...>
              Control  verbosity  directly  for each module.  The ’all’ module
              changes the verbosity of all the modules not  explicitly  speci‐
              fied  on  the  command line.  See ’-msglevel help’ for a list of
              all modules.
              NOTE: Messages printed before the command line is parsed can  be
              controlled  only  by  the  MPLAYER_VERBOSE environment variable,
              which applies to all modules.
              Available levels:
                 -1   complete silence
                  0   fatal messages only

                  4   informational messages
                  5   status messages (those hidden by -quiet)
                  6   verbose messages
                  7   debug level 2
                  8   debug level 3
                  9   debug level 4

       -quiet
              Make console output less verbose; in  particular,  prevents  the
              status  line (i.e. A:   0.7 V:   0.6 A-V:  0.068 ...) from being
              displayed.  Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken ones
              which do not properly handle carriage return (i.e. \r).

       -priority <prio> (Windows only)
              Set  process  priority  for  MPlayer according to the predefined
              priorities available under Windows.  Possible values of <prio>:
                 idle|belownormal|normal|abovenormal|high|realtime

              WARNING: Using realtime priority can cause system lockup.

       -profile <profile1,profile2,...>
              Use the given profile(s), -profile help displays a list  of  the
              defined profiles.

       -really-quiet (also see -quiet)
              Display  even  less output and status messages than with -quiet.
              Also suppresses the GUI error message boxes.

       -show-profile <profile>
              Show the description and content of a profile.

       -use-filedir-conf
              Look for a file-specific configuration file in the same directo‐
              ry as the file that is being played.
              WARNING: May be dangerous if playing from untrusted media.

       -v
              Increment  verbosity  level,  one level for each -v found on the
              command line.

PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -autoq <quality> (use with -vf [s]pp)
              Dynamically changes the level of postprocessing depending on the
              available  spare  CPU  time.  The number you specify will be the
              maximum level used.  Usually you can use some big  number.   You
              have  to  use  -vf [s]pp without parameters in order for this to
              work.

       -autosync <factor>
              Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based  on  audio  delay  measure‐
              ments.   Specifying  -autosync  0, the default, will cause frame
              timing to be based entirely on audio delay measurements.  Speci‐
              fying  -autosync  1 will do the same, but will subtly change the
              A/V correction algorithm.  An uneven video framerate in a  movie
              which  plays  fine  with -nosound can often be helped by setting
              this to an integer value greater than 1.  The higher the  value,
              the  closer the timing will be to -nosound.  Try -autosync 30 to
              smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not implement  a
              perfect  audio delay measurement.  With this value, if large A/V
              sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or 2 seconds  to
              settle  out.   This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets
              should be the only side-effect of turning this  option  on,  for
              all sound drivers.

       -benchmark
              Prints  some  statistics  on CPU usage and dropped frames at the
              end of playback.  Use in combination with -nosound and -vo  null
              for benchmarking only the video codec.
              NOTE:  With  this option MPlayer will also ignore frame duration
              when playing only video (you can think of that as infinite fps).

       -colorkey <number>
              Changes  the  colorkey to an RGB value of your choice.  0x000000
              is black and 0xffffff is white.  Only supported by  the  cvidix,
              fbdev,  svga,  vesa,  winvidix, xmga, xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo
              xv:ck), xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       -nocolorkey
              Disables colorkeying.  Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev,  sv‐
              ga,  vesa,  winvidix,  xmga,  xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo xv:ck),
              xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       -correct-pts (experimental)
              Switches MPlayer to an experimental mode  where  timestamps  for
              video  frames are calculated differently and video filters which
              add new frames or modify timestamps of existing  ones  are  sup‐
              ported.  The more accurate timestamps can be visible for example
              when playing subtitles timed to scene changes with the -ass  op‐
              tion.   Without  -correct-pts the subtitle timing will typically
              be off by some frames.  This option does not work correctly with
              some demuxers and codecs.

       -crash-debug (DEBUG CODE)
              Automatically  attaches gdb upon crash or SIGTRAP.  Support must
              be compiled in by configuring with --enable-crash-debug.

       -doubleclick-time
              Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive button presses
              as  a double-click (default: 300).  Set to 0 to let your window‐
              ing system decide what a double-click is (-vo directx only).
              NOTE: You will get slightly  different  behaviour  depending  on
              whether you bind MOUSE_BTN0_DBL or MOUSE_BTN0-MOUSE_BTN0_DBL.

       -edlout <filename>
              Creates  a  new file and writes edit decision list (EDL) records
              to it.  During playback, the user hits ’i’ to mark the start  or
              end  of a skip block.  This provides a starting point from which
              the user can fine-tune EDL entries later.  See http://www.mplay‐
              erhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details.

       -enqueue (GUI only)
              Enqueue  files given on the command line in the playlist instead
              of playing them immediately.

       -fixed-vo
              Enforces a fixed video system for multiple files  (one  (un)ini‐
              tialization  for  all files).  Therefore only one window will be
              opened for all  files.   Currently  the  following  drivers  are
              fixed-vo  compliant:  gl,  gl2, mga, svga, x11, xmga, xv, xvidix
              and dfbmga.

       -framedrop (also see -hardframedrop)
              Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync  on  slow  sys‐
              tems.   Video  filters  are  not applied to such frames.  For B-
              frames even decoding is skipped completely.

       -(no)gui
              Enable or disable the GUI interface (default depends  on  binary
              name).   Only  works  as the first argument on the command line.
              Does not work as a config-file option.

       -h, -help, --help
              Show short summary of options.

       -hardframedrop
              More intense frame dropping (breaks decoding).  Leads  to  image
              distortion!

       -identify
              Shorthand  for -msglevel identify=4.  Show file parameters in an
              easily parseable format.  Also prints more detailed  information
              about subtitle and audio track languages and IDs.  In some cases
              you can get more information by using -msglevel identify=6.  For
              example,  for  a DVD it will list the time length of each title,
              as well as a disk ID.  The wrapper script  TOOLS/midentify  sup‐
              presses  the  other  MPlayer output and (hopefully) shellescapes
              the filenames.

       -idle (also see -slave)
              Makes MPlayer wait idly instead of quitting  when  there  is  no
              file  to play.  Mostly useful in slave mode where MPlayer can be
              controlled through input commands.

       -input <commands>
              This option can be used to configure certain parts of the  input
              system.  Paths are relative to ~/.mplayer/.
              NOTE: Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.

              Available commands are:

                 conf=<filename>
                      Specify  input configuration file other than the default
                      ~/.mplayer/input.conf.  ~/.mplayer/<filename> is assumed
                      if no full path is given.
                 ar-delay
                      Delay  in  milliseconds  before we start to autorepeat a
                      key (0 to disable).
                 ar-rate
                      Number of key presses to generate per second on  autore‐
                      peat.
                 keylist
                      Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.
                 cmdlist
                      Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.
                 js-dev
                      Specifies  the joystick device to use (default: /dev/in‐
                      put/js0).
                 file=<filename>
                      Read commands from the given file.  Mostly useful with a
                      FIFO.
                      NOTE:  When  the given file is a FIFO MPlayer opens both
                      ends so you can do several ’echo "seek  10"  >  mp_pipe’
                      and the pipe will stay valid.

       -key-fifo-size <2-65000>
              Specify  the  size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default:
              7).  A FIFO of size n can buffer (n-1) events.   If  it  is  too
              small  some events may be lost (leading to "stuck mouse buttons"
              and similar effects).  If it is too big,  MPlayer  may  seem  to
              hang  while  it  processes the buffered events.  To get the same
              behavior as before this option was introduced, set it to  2  for
              Linux or 1024 for Windows.

       -lircconf <filename> (LIRC only)
              Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (default: ~/.lircrc).

       -list-properties
              Print a list of the available properties.

       -loop <number>
              Loops movie playback <number> times.  0 means forever.

       -menu (OSD menu only)
              Turn on OSD menu support.

       -menu-cfg <filename> (OSD menu only)
              Use an alternative menu.conf.

       -menu-chroot <path> (OSD menu only)
              Chroot the file selection menu to a specific location.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -menu-chroot=/home
                      Will restrict the file selection menu to /home and down‐
                      ward  (i.e.  no  access  to  /  will  be  possible,  but
                      /home/user_name will).

       -menu-keepdir (OSD menu only)
              File browser starts from the last known location instead of cur‐
              rent directory.

       -menu-root <value> (OSD menu only)
              Specify the main menu.

       -menu-startup (OSD menu only)
              Display the main menu at MPlayer startup.

       -mouse-movements
              Permit MPlayer to receive pointer events reported by  the  video
              output driver (currently only derivatives of X11 are supported).
              Necessary to select the buttons in DVD menus.

       -noconsolecontrols
              Prevent MPlayer from reading key  events  from  standard  input.
              Useful when reading data from standard input.  This is automati‐
              cally enabled when - is found on the command  line.   There  are
              situations  where  you have to set it manually, e.g. if you open
              /dev/stdin (or the equivalent on your system), use  stdin  in  a
              playlist  or intend to read from stdin later on via the loadfile
              or loadlist slave commands.

       -nojoystick
              Turns off joystick support.

       -nolirc
              Turns off LIRC support.

       -nomouseinput
              Disable mouse button press/release input (mozplayerxp’s  context
              menu relies on this option).

       -rtc (RTC only)
              Turns  on  usage of the Linux RTC (realtime clock - /dev/rtc) as
              timing mechanism.  This wakes up the process every  1/1024  sec‐
              onds  to check the current time.  Useless with modern Linux ker‐
              nels configured for desktop use as they already wake up the pro‐
              cess with similar accuracy when using normal timed sleep.

       -playing-msg <string>
              Print  out a string before starting playback.  The following ex‐
              pansions are supported:

                 ${NAME}
                      Expand to the value of the property NAME.

                 $(NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is available.

       -playlist <filename>
              Play files according to a playlist file (ASX, Winamp,  SMIL,  or
              one-file-per-line format).
              NOTE:  This option is considered an entry so options found after
              it will apply only to the elements of this playlist.
              FIXME: This needs to be clarified and documented thoroughly.

       -rtc-device <device>
              Use the specified device for RTC timing.

       -shuffle
              Play files in random order.

       -skin <name> (GUI only)
              Loads a skin from the directory given as parameter below the de‐
              fault   skin   directories,  /usr/local/share/mplayer/skins/ and
              ~/.mplayer/skins/.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -skin fittyfene
                      Tries /usr/local/share/mplayer/skins/fittyfene  and  af‐
                      terwards ~/.mplayer/skins/fittyfene.

       -slave (also see -input)
              Switches  on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend for
              other programs.  Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlay‐
              er will read commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.
              NOTE:  See  -input  cmdlist  for  a  list  of slave commands and
              DOCS/tech/slave.txt for their description.

       -softsleep
              Time frames by repeatedly checking the current time  instead  of
              asking  the kernel to wake up MPlayer at the correct time.  Use‐
              ful if your kernel timing is imprecise and you  cannot  use  the
              RTC either.  Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.

       -sstep <sec>
              Skip  <sec>  seconds after every frame.  The normal framerate of
              the movie is kept, so playback is  accelerated.   Since  MPlayer
              can only seek to the next keyframe this may be inexact.

DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS
       -a52drc <level>
              Select  the  Dynamic  Range  Compression  level  for  AC3  audio
              streams.  <level> is a float value ranging from 0 to 1, where  0
              means  no  compression  and  1 (which is the default) means full
              compression (make loud passages more  silent  and  vice  versa).
              This  option only shows an effect if the AC3 stream contains the
              required range compression information.

       -aid <ID> (also see -alang)
              Select audio channel (MPEG: 0-31, AVI/OGM: 1-99, ASF/RM:  0-127,
              VOB(AC3): 128-159, VOB(LPCM): 160-191, MPEG-TS 17-8190).  MPlay‐
              er prints the available audio IDs when run in verbose (-v) mode.
              When  playing  an  MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder will use the
              first program (if present) with the chosen audio stream.

       -alang <language code[,language code,...]> (also see -aid)
              Specify a priority list of audio languages  to  use.   Different
              container formats employ different language codes.  DVDs use ISO
              639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska, MPEG-TS and  NUT  use
              ISO 639-2 three letter language codes while OGM uses a free-form
              identifier.  MPlayer prints the available languages when run  in
              verbose (-v) mode.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer dvd://1 -alang hu,en
                      Chooses  the Hungarian language track on a DVD and falls
                      back on English if Hungarian is not available.
                 mplayer -alang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file in Japanese.

       -audio-demuxer <[+]name> (-audiofile only)
              Force audio demuxer type for -audiofile.  Use a ’+’  before  the
              name  to force it, this will skip some checks!  Give the demuxer
              name as printed by -audio-demuxer help.  For  backward  compati‐
              bility  it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/
              demuxer.h.  -audio-demuxer audio  or  -audio-demuxer  17  forces
              MP3.

       -audiofile <filename>
              Play  audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while
              viewing a movie.

       -audiofile-cache <kBytes>
              Enables caching for the stream used  by  -audiofile,  using  the
              specified amount of memory.

       -reuse-socket (udp:// only)
              Allows a socket to be reused by other processes as soon as it is
              closed.

       -bandwidth <value> (network only)
              Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers
              that are able to send content in different bitrates).  Useful if
              you want to watch live streamed media behind a slow  connection.
              With Real RTSP streaming, it is also used to set the maximum de‐
              livery bandwidth allowing faster cache filling and stream  dump‐
              ing.

       -cache <kBytes>
              This  option  specifies  how much memory (in kBytes) to use when
              precaching a file or URL.  Especially useful on slow media.

       -nocache
              Turns off caching.

       -cache-min <percentage>
              Playback will start when the cache has been filled up  to  <per‐
              centage> of the total.

       -cache-seek-min <percentage>
              If a seek is to be made to a position within <percentage> of the
              cache size from the current position, MPlayer will wait for  the
              cache  to  be  filled  to this position rather than performing a
              stream seek (default: 50).

       -cdda <option1:option2> (CDDA only)
              This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature  of
              MPlayer.

              Available options are:

                 speed=<value>
                      Set CD spin speed.

                 paranoia=<0-2>
                      Set  paranoia  level.  Values other than 0 seem to break
                      playback of anything but the first track.
                         0: disable checking (default)
                         1: overlap checking only
                         2: full data correction and verification

                 generic-dev=<value>
                      Use specified generic SCSI device.

                 sector-size=<value>
                      Set atomic read size.

                 overlap=<value>
                      Force minimum  overlap  search  during  verification  to
                      <value> sectors.

                 toc-bias
                      Assume  that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported
                      in the TOC will be addressed as  LBA  0.   Some  Toshiba
                      drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.

                 toc-offset=<value>
                      Add <value> sectors to the values reported when address‐
                      ing tracks.  May be negative.

                 (no)skip
                      (Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.

       -cdrom-device <path to device>
              Specify the CD-ROM device (default: /dev/cdrom).

       -channels <number> (also see -af channels)
              Request the number of playback channels (default:  2).   MPlayer
              asks  the  decoder  to decode the audio into as many channels as
              specified.  Then it is up to the decoder to fulfill the require‐
              ment.   This  is usually only important when playing videos with
              AC3 audio (like DVDs).  In that case liba52 does the decoding by
              default  and  correctly  downmixes  the audio into the requested
              number of channels.  To directly control the  number  of  output
              channels independently of how many channels are decoded, use the
              channels filter.
              NOTE: This option is honored by codecs (AC3 only), filters (sur‐
              round) and audio output drivers (OSS at least).

              Available options are:

                 2    stereo
                 4    surround
                 6    full 5.1

       -chapter <chapter ID>[-<endchapter ID>] (dvd:// and dvdnav:// only)
              Specify  which  chapter to start playing at.  Optionally specify
              which chapter to end playing at (default: 1).

       -cookies (network only)
              Send cookies when making HTTP requests.

       -cookies-file <filename> (network only)
              Read HTTP cookies  from  <filename>  (default:  ~/.mozilla/  and
              ~/.netscape/) and skip reading from default locations.  The file
              is assumed to be in Netscape format.

       -delay <sec>
              audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value)
              Negative values delay the audio, and positive values  delay  the
              video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of the -audio-delay
              MEncoder option.
              NOTE: When used with MEncoder, this is not  guaranteed  to  work
              correctly with -ovc copy; use -audio-delay instead.

       -ignore-start
              Ignore the specified starting time for streams in AVI files.  In
              MPlayer, this nullifies stream delays in files encoded with  the
              -audio-delay option.  During encoding, this option prevents MEn‐
              coder from transferring original stream start times to  the  new
              file;  the  -audio-delay option is not affected.  Note that MEn‐
              coder sometimes adjusts stream starting times  automatically  to
              compensate  for  anticipated decoding delays, so do not use this
              option for encoding without testing it first.

       -demuxer <[+]name>
              Force demuxer type.  Use a ’+’ before the name to force it, this
              will skip some checks!  Give the demuxer name as printed by -de‐
              muxer help.  For backward compatibility it also accepts the  de‐
              muxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.

       -dumpaudio (MPlayer only)
              Dumps  raw compressed audio stream to ./stream.dump (useful with
              MPEG/AC3, in most other cases the resulting  file  will  not  be
              playable).  If you give more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       -dumpfile <filename> (MPlayer only)
              Specify which file MPlayer should dump to.  Should be  used  to‐
              gether with -dumpaudio / -dumpvideo / -dumpstream.

       -dumpstream (MPlayer only)
              Dumps the raw stream to ./stream.dump.  Useful when ripping from
              DVD or network.  If  you  give  more  than  one  of  -dumpaudio,
              -dumpvideo,  -dumpstream  on  the command line only the last one
              will work.

       -dumpvideo (MPlayer only)
              Dump raw compressed video stream to ./stream.dump (not very  us‐
              able).   If  you  give  more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       -dvbin <options> (DVB only)
              Pass the following parameters to the DVB input module, in  order
              to override the default ones:

                 card=<1-4>
                      Specifies using card number 1-4 (default: 1).
                 file=<filename>
                      Instructs  MPlayer to read the channels list from <file‐
                      name>.         Default        is        ~/.mplayer/chan‐
                      nels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc}  (based  on your card type)
                      or ~/.mplayer/channels.conf as a last resort.
                 timeout=<1-30>
                      Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying to tune  a
                      frequency before giving up (default: 30).

       -dvd-device <path to device> (DVD only)
              Specify the DVD device (default: /dev/dvd).  You can also speci‐
              fy a directory that contains files  previously  copied  directly
              from  a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy).  Note that using -dumpstream is
              usually a better way to copy DVD titles in the first place  (see
              the examples).

       -dvd-speed <factor or speed in KB/s> (DVD only)
              Try  to limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change).  DVD base speed
              is about 1350KB/s, so a 8x  drive  can  read  at  speeds  up  to
              10800KB/s.   Slower speeds make the drive more quiet, for watch‐
              ing DVDs 2700KB/s should be quiet and fast enough.  MPlayer  re‐
              sets the speed to the drive default value on close.  Values less
              than 100 mean multiples of 1350KB/s, i.e. -dvd-speed  8  selects
              10800KB/s.
              NOTE:  You  need  write  access  to the DVD device to change the
              speed.

       -dvdangle <angle ID> (DVD only)
              Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed  from  multiple
              angles.  Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default:
              1).

       -edl <filename>
              Enables edit decision list (EDL) actions during playback.  Video
              will be skipped over and audio will be muted and unmuted accord‐
              ing to the entries in the given file.   See  http://www.mplayer‐
              hq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.

       -endpos <[[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]|size[b|kb|mb]> (also see -ss and -sb)
              Stop at given time or byte position.
              NOTE: Byte position is enabled only for MEncoder and will not be
              accurate, as it can only stop at a frame boundary.  When used in
              conjunction  with -ss option, -endpos time will shift forward by
              seconds specified with -ss.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 56 seconds.
                 -endpos 01:10:00
                      Stop at 1 hour 10 minutes.
                 -ss 10 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 1 minute 6 seconds.
                 -endpos 100mb
                      Encode only 100 MB.

       -forceidx
              Force index rebuilding.  Useful for files with broken index (A/V
              desync,  etc).   This will enable seeking in files where seeking
              was not possible.  You can fix the index permanently  with  MEn‐
              coder (see the documentation).
              NOTE:  This  option  only works if the underlying media supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       -fps <float value>
              Override video framerate.  Useful if the original value is wrong
              or missing.

       -frames <number>
              Play/convert only first <number> frames, then quit.

       -hr-mp3-seek (MP3 only)
              Hi-res  MP3  seeking.  Enabled when playing from an external MP3
              file, as we need to seek to the very exact position to keep  A/V
              sync.   Can  be  slow especially when seeking backwards since it
              has to rewind to the beginning to find an exact frame  position.

       -idx (also see -forceidx)
              Rebuilds index of files if no index was found, allowing seeking.
              Useful with broken/incomplete downloads, or badly created files.
              NOTE:  This  option  only works if the underlying media supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       -noidx Skip rebuilding index file.  MEncoder skips  writing  the  index
              with this option.

       -ipv4-only-proxy (network only)
              Skip  the  proxy  for IPv6 addresses.  It will still be used for
              IPv4 connections.

       -loadidx <index file>
              The file from which to  read  the  video  index  data  saved  by
              -saveidx.   This  index will be used for seeking, overriding any
              index data contained in the AVI itself.  MPlayer will  not  pre‐
              vent  you  from loading an index file generated from a different
              AVI, but this is sure to cause unfavorable results.
              NOTE: This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML  sup‐
              port.

       -mc <seconds/frame>
              maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)

       -mf <option1:option2:...>
              Used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files.

              Available options are:

                 w=<value>
                      input file width (default: autodetect)
                 h=<value>
                      input file height (default: autodetect)
                 fps=<value>
                      output fps (default: 25)
                 type=<value>
                      input file type (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi)

       -ni (AVI only)
              Force  usage  of  non-interleaved  AVI parser (fixes playback of
              some bad AVI files).

       -nobps (AVI only)
              Do not use average byte/second value for A-V sync.   Helps  with
              some AVI files with broken header.

       -noextbased
              Disables  extension-based  demuxer  selection.  By default, when
              the file type (demuxer) cannot be detected  reliably  (the  file
              has no header or it is not reliable enough), the filename exten‐
              sion is used to select the demuxer.  Always falls back  on  con‐
              tent-based demuxer selection.

       -passwd <password> (also see -user) (network only)
              Specify password for HTTP authentication.

       -prefer-ipv4 (network only)
              Use  IPv4  on network connections.  Falls back on IPv6 automati‐
              cally.

       -prefer-ipv6 (IPv6 network only)
              Use IPv6 on network connections.  Falls back on  IPv4  automati‐
              cally.

       -psprobe <byte position>
              When playing an MPEG-PS stream, this option lets you specify how
              many bytes in the stream you want MPlayer to scan  in  order  to
              identify  the  video  codec used.  This option is needed to play
              EVO files containing H.264 streams.

       -pvr <option1:option2:...> (PVR only)
              This option tunes various encoding properties of the PVR capture
              module.   It has to be used with any hardware MPEG encoder based
              card  supported  by  the  V4L2  driver.   The  Hauppauge   WinTV
              PVR-150/250/350/500  and  all  IVTV based cards are known as PVR
              capture cards.  Be aware that only Linux 2.6.18 kernel and above
              is  able to handle MPEG stream through V4L2 layer.  For hardware
              capture of an MPEG stream and watching it with MPlayer/MEncoder,
              use ’pvr://’ as a movie URL.

              Available options are:

                 aspect=<0-3>
                      Specify input aspect ratio:
                         0: 1:1
                         1: 4:3 (default)
                         2: 16:9
                         3: 2.21:1

                 arate=<32000-48000>
                      Specify  encoding  audio rate (default: 48000 Hz, avail‐
                      able: 32000, 44100 and 48000 Hz).

                 alayer=<1-3>
                      Specify MPEG audio layer encoding (default: 2).

                 abitrate=<32-448>
                      Specify audio encoding bitrate in kbps (default: 384).

                 amode=<value>
                      Specify audio encoding mode.   Available  preset  values
                      are  ’stereo’,  ’joint_stereo’,  ’dual’  and ’mono’ (de‐
                      fault: stereo).

                 vbitrate=<value>
                      Specify average video bitrate encoding in Mbps (default:
                      6).

                 vmode=<value>
                      Specify video encoding mode:
                         vbr: Variable BitRate (default)
                         cbr: Constant BitRate

                 vpeak=<value>
                      Specify peak video bitrate encoding in Mbps (only useful
                      for VBR encoding, default: 9.6).

                 fmt=<value>
                      Choose an MPEG format for encoding:
                         ps:    MPEG-2 Program Stream (default)
                         ts:    MPEG-2 Transport Stream
                         mpeg1: MPEG-1 System Stream
                         vcd:   Video CD compatible stream
                         svcd:  Super Video CD compatible stream
                         dvd:   DVD compatible stream

       -radio <option1:option2:...> (radio only)
              These options set various parameters of the radio  capture  mod‐
              ule.  For listening to radio with MPlayer use ’radio://<frequen‐
              cy>’ (if channels option is not given) or ’radio://<channel_num‐
              ber>’ (if channels option is given) as a movie URL.  You can see
              allowed frequency range by running MPlayer with ’-v’.  To  start
              the grabbing subsystem, use ’radio://<frequency or channel>/cap‐
              ture’.  If the capture keyword is not given you  can  listen  to
              radio  using the line-in cable only.  Using capture to listen is
              not recommended due to  synchronization  problems,  which  makes
              this process uncomfortable.

              Available options are:

                 device=<value>
                      Radio  device to use (default: /dev/radio0 for Linux and
                      /dev/tuner0 for *BSD).

                 driver=<value>
                      Radio driver to use (default: v4l2 if available,  other‐
                      wise v4l).  Currently, v4l and v4l2 drivers are support‐
                      ed.

                 volume=<0..100>
                      sound volume for radio device (default 100)

                 freq_min=<value>
                      minimum allowed frequency (default: 87.50)

                 freq_max=<value>
                      maximum allowed frequency (default: 108.00)

                 channels=<frequency>-<name>,<frequency>-<name>,...
                      Set channel list.  Use _ for spaces in  names  (or  play
                      with  quoting ;-).  The channel names will then be writ‐
                      ten using OSD and the slave commands  radio_step_channel
                      and  radio_set_channel  will be usable for a remote con‐
                      trol (see LIRC).  If given, number in movie URL will  be
                      treated as channel position in channel list.
                      EXAMPLE: radio://1, radio://104.4, radio_set_channel 1

                 adevice=<value>
                      Name  of  device  to capture sound from.  Without such a
                      name capture will be disabled, even if the capture  key‐
                      word appears in the URL.  For ALSA devices use it in the
                      form hw=<card>.<device>.  If the device name contains  a
                      ’=’, the module will use ALSA to capture, otherwise OSS.

                 arate=<value>
                      Rate in samples per second (default: 44100).
                      NOTE:  When  using  audio  capture  set  also  -rawaudio
                      rate=<value>  option  with  the same value as arate.  If
                      you have problems with sound speed (runs  too  quickly),
                      try   to   play   with   different   rate  values  (e.g.
                      48000,44100,32000,...).

                 achannels=<value>
                      Number of audio channels to capture.

       -rawaudio <option1:option2:...>
              This option lets you play raw audio files.  You have to use -de‐
              muxer  rawaudio  as well.  It may also be used to play audio CDs
              which are not 44kHz 16-bit stereo.  For playing raw AC3  streams
              use -rawaudio format=0x2000 -demuxer rawaudio.

              Available options are:

                 channels=<value>
                      number of channels
                 rate=<value>
                      rate in samples per second
                 samplesize=<value>
                      sample size in bytes
                 bitrate=<value>
                      bitrate for rawaudio files
                 format=<value>
                      fourcc in hex

       -rawvideo <option1:option2:...>
              This option lets you play raw video files.  You have to use -de‐
              muxer rawvideo as well.

              Available options are:

                 fps=<value>
                      rate in frames per second (default: 25.0)
                 sqcif|qcif|cif|4cif|pal|ntsc
                      set standard image size
                 w=<value>
                      image width in pixels
                 h=<value>
                      image height in pixels
                 i420|yv12|yuy2|y8
                      set colorspace
                 format=<value>
                      colorspace (fourcc) in hex
                 size=<value>
                      frame size in Bytes

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer foreman.qcif -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo qcif
                      Play the famous "foreman" sample video.
                 mplayer  sample-720x576.yuv   -demuxer   rawvideo   -rawvideo
                 w=720:h=576
                      Play a raw YUV sample.

       -rtsp-port
              Used with ’rtsp://’ URLs to  force  the  client’s  port  number.
              This option may be useful if you are behind a router and want to
              forward the RTSP stream from the server to a specific client.

       -rtsp-destination
              Used with ’rtsp://’ URLs to force the destination IP address  to
              be bound.  This option may be useful with some RTSP server which
              do not send RTP packets to the right interface.  If the  connec‐
              tion  to  the  RTSP server fails, use -v to see which IP address
              MPlayer tries to bind to and try to force it to one assigned  to
              your computer instead.

       -rtsp-stream-over-tcp (LIVE555 only)
              Used  with ’rtsp://’ URLs to specify that the resulting incoming
              RTP and RTCP packets be streamed over TCP (using  the  same  TCP
              connection  as  RTSP).   This option may be useful if you have a
              broken internet connection that does not pass incoming UDP pack‐
              ets (see http://www.live555.com/mplayer/).

       -saveidx <filename>
              Force  index  rebuilding and dump the index to <filename>.  Cur‐
              rently this only works with AVI files.
              NOTE: This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML  sup‐
              port.

       -sb <byte position> (also see -ss)
              Seek  to  byte position.  Useful for playback from CD-ROM images
              or VOB files with junk at the beginning.

       -speed <0.01-100>
              Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given as parameter.
              Not guaranteed to work correctly with -oac copy.

       -srate <Hz>
              Selects the output sample rate to be used (of course sound cards
              have limits on this).  If the sample frequency selected is  dif‐
              ferent  from  that of the current media, the resample or lavcre‐
              sample audio filter will be inserted into the audio filter layer
              to compensate for the difference.  The type of resampling can be
              controlled by the -af-adv option.  The default  is  fast  resam‐
              pling that may cause distortion.

       -ss <time> (also see -sb)
              Seek to given time position.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ss 56
                      Seeks to 56 seconds.
                 -ss 01:10:00
                      Seeks to 1 hour 10 min.

       -tskeepbroken
              Tells  MPlayer  not  to discard TS packets reported as broken in
              the stream.  Sometimes needed to play corrupted MPEG-TS files.

       -tsprobe <byte position>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, this option lets you specify how
              many  bytes in the stream you want MPlayer to search for the de‐
              sired audio and video IDs.

       -tsprog <1-65534>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, you can specify with this option
              which  program  (if present) you want to play.  Can be used with
              -vid and -aid.

       -tv <option1:option2:...> (TV/PVR only)
              This option tunes various properties of the TV  capture  module.
              For watching TV with MPlayer, use ’tv://’ or ’tv://<channel_num‐
              ber>’ or even  ’tv://<channel_name>  (see  option  channels  for
              channel_name below) as a movie URL.

              Available options are:

                 noaudio
                      no sound

                 automute=<0-255>
                      If  signal strength reported by device is less than this
                      value, audio and video will be muted.  In most cases au‐
                      tomute=100  will be enough.  Default is 0 (automute dis‐
                      abled).

                 driver=<value>
                      See -tv driver=help for a list of compiled-in  TV  input
                      drivers.  available: dummy, v4l, v4l2, bsdbt848

                 device=<value>
                      Specify TV device (default: /dev/video0).  NOTE: For the
                      bsdbt848 driver you can provide both bktr and tuner  de‐
                      vice names separating them with a comma, tuner after bk‐
                      tr (e.g. -tv device=/dev/bktr1,/dev/tuner1).

                 input=<value>
                      Specify input (default: 0 (TV), see console  output  for
                      available inputs).

                 freq=<value>
                      Specify   the  frequency  to  set  the  tuner  to  (e.g.
                      511.250).  Not compatible with the channels parameter.

                 outfmt=<value>
                      Specify the output format of the  tuner  with  a  preset
                      value  supported  by the V4L driver (yv12, rgb32, rgb24,
                      rgb16, rgb15, uyvy, yuy2, i420) or an  arbitrary  format
                      given  as  hex value.  Try outfmt=help for a list of all
                      available formats.

                 width=<value>
                      output window width

                 height=<value>
                      output window height

                 fps=<value>
                      framerate at which to capture video (frames per second)

                 buffersize=<value>
                      maximum size of the capture  buffer  in  megabytes  (de‐
                      fault: dynamical)

                 norm=<value>
                      For  bsdbt848  and  v4l, PAL, SECAM, NTSC are available.
                      For v4l2, see the console  output  for  a  list  of  all
                      available norms, also see the normid option below.

                 normid=<value> (v4l2 only)
                      Sets  the  TV norm to the given numeric ID.  The TV norm
                      depends on the capture card.  See the console output for
                      a list of available TV norms.

                 channel=<value>
                      Set tuner to <value> channel.

                 chanlist=<value>
                      available: europe-east, europe-west, us-bcast, us-cable,
                      etc

                 channels=<channel>-<name>,<channel>-<name>,...
                      Set names for channels.  NOTE: If <channel> is an  inte‐
                      ger  greater  than 1000, it will be treated as frequency
                      (in kHz) rather than channel name from frequency  table.
                      Use  _  for  spaces  in names (or play with quoting ;-).
                      The channel names will then be written  using  OSD,  and
                      the  slave  commands tv_step_channel, tv_set_channel and
                      tv_last_channel will be usable for a remote control (see
                      LIRC).  Not compatible with the frequency parameter.
                      NOTE:  The  channel  number will then be the position in
                      the ’channels’ list, beginning with 1.
                      EXAMPLE:    tv://1,    tv://TV1,    tv_set_channel    1,
                      tv_set_channel TV1

                 [brightness|contrast|hue|saturation]=<-100-100>
                      Set the image equalizer on the card.

                 audiorate=<value>
                      Set audio capture bitrate.

                 forceaudio
                      Capture audio even if there are no audio sources report‐
                      ed by v4l.

                 alsa
                      Capture from ALSA.

                 amode=<0-3>
                      Choose an audio mode:
                         0: mono
                         1: stereo
                         2: language 1
                         3: language 2

                 forcechan=<1-2>
                      By default, the count of recorded audio channels is  de‐
                      termined  automatically  by querying the audio mode from
                      the TV card.  This  option  allows  forcing  stereo/mono
                      recording  regardless of the amode option and the values
                      returned by v4l.  This can be used  for  troubleshooting
                      when  the  TV card is unable to report the current audio
                      mode.

                 adevice=<value>
                      Set an audio device.  <value> should be /dev/xxx for OSS
                      and a hardware ID for ALSA.  You must replace any ’:’ by
                      a ’.’ in the hardware ID for ALSA.

                 audioid=<value>
                      Choose an audio output of the capture card,  if  it  has
                      more than one.

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=<0-65535> (v4l1)

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=<0-100> (v4l2)
                      These  options  set parameters of the mixer on the video
                      capture card.  They will have no effect,  if  your  card
                      does not have one.  For v4l2 50 maps to the default val‐
                      ue of the control, as reported by the driver.

                 immediatemode=<bool>
                      A value of 0 means capture and buffer  audio  and  video
                      together  (default for MEncoder).  A value of 1 (default
                      for MPlayer) means to do video capture only and let  the
                      audio  go  through  a loopback cable from the TV card to
                      the sound card.

                 mjpeg
                      Use hardware MJPEG compression  (if  the  card  supports
                      it).  When using this option, you do not need to specify
                      the width and  height  of  the  output  window,  because
                      MPlayer will determine it automatically from the decima‐
                      tion value (see below).

                 decimation=<1|2|4>
                      choose the size of the picture that will  be  compressed
                      by hardware MJPEG compression:
                         1: full size
                             704x576    PAL
                             704x480    NTSC
                         2: medium size
                             352x288    PAL
                             352x240    NTSC
                         4: small size
                             176x144    PAL
                             176x120    NTSC

                 quality=<0-100>
                      Choose  the quality of the JPEG compression (< 60 recom‐
                      mended for full size).

       -user <username> (also see -passwd) (network only)
              Specify username for HTTP authentication.

       -user-agent <string>
              Use <string> as user agent for HTTP streaming.

       -vid <ID>
              Select video channel (MPG: 0-15, ASF: 0-255, MPEG-TS:  17-8190).
              When  playing  an  MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder will use the
              first program (if present) with the chosen video stream.

       -vivo <sub-options> (DEBUG CODE)
              Force audio parameters for the VIVO demuxer (for debugging  pur‐
              poses).

       NOTE: Also see -vf expand.

       -ass (FreeType only)
              Turn  on  SSA/ASS  subtitle rendering.  With this option, libass
              will be used for SSA/ASS external subtitles and Matroska tracks.
              You may also want to use -embeddedfonts.

       -ass-border-color <value>
              Sets  the  border (outline) color for text subtitles.  The color
              format is RRGGBBAA.

       -ass-bottom-margin <value>
              Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame.  The SSA/ASS  ren‐
              derer can place subtitles there (with -ass-use-margins).

       -ass-color <value>
              Sets  the  color for text subtitles.  The color format is RRGGB‐
              BAA.

       -ass-font-scale <value>
              Set the scale coefficient to be used for fonts  in  the  SSA/ASS
              renderer.

       -ass-force-style <[Style.]Param=Value[,...]>
              Override some style parameters.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ass-force-style FontName=Arial,Default.Bold=1

       -ass-hinting <type>
              Set hinting type.
                 <type>
                      0: No hinting.
                      1: FreeType autohinter, light mode.
                      2: FreeType autohinter, normal mode.
                      3: Font native hinter.
                      0-3 + 4: The same, but hinting will only be performed if
                      OSD is rendered at  screen  resolution  and,  therefore,
                      will not be scaled.
                      The  default  value is 7 (use native hinter for unscaled
                      OSD and no hinting otherwise).

       -ass-line-spacing <value>
              Set line spacing value for SSA/ASS renderer.

       -ass-styles <filename>
              Load all SSA/ASS styles found in the specified file and use them
              for rendering text subtitles.  The syntax of the file is exactly
              like the [V4 Styles] / [V4+ Styles] section of SSA/ASS.

       -ass-top-margin <value>
              Adds a black band at the top of the frame.  The SSA/ASS renderer
              can place toptitles there (with -ass-use-margins).

       -(no)ass-use-margins
              Enables/disables  placing  toptitles and subtitles in black bor‐
              ders when they are available (default: no).

       -dumpjacosub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the  time-based  JACOsub  subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.js
              file in the current directory.

       -dumpmicrodvdsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the MicroDVD subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.sub file in the
              current directory.

       -dumpmpsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              MPlayer’s  subtitle format, MPsub.  Creates a dump.mpsub file in
              the current directory.

       -dumpsami (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the time-based SAMI subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.smi file
              in the current directory.

       -dumpsrtsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the time-based SubViewer (SRT) subtitle format.  Creates a dump‐
              sub.srt file in the current directory.
              NOTE: Some broken hardware players choke on SRT  subtitle  files
              with  Unix line endings.  If you are unlucky enough to have such
              a box, pass your subtitle files through unix2dos  or  a  similar
              program  to replace Unix line endings with DOS/Windows line end‐
              ings.

       -dumpsub (MPlayer only) (BETA CODE)
              Dumps the subtitle substream from VOB  streams.   Also  see  the
              -dump*sub and -vobsubout* options.

       -(no)embeddedfonts (FreeType only)
              Enables  extraction  of  Matroska  embedded fonts (default: dis‐
              abled).  These fonts can be used for SSA/ASS subtitle  rendering
              (-ass  option).   Font files are created in the ~/.mplayer/fonts
              directory.
              NOTE: With FontConfig 2.4.2 or newer, embedded fonts are  opened
              directly from memory, and this option is enabled by default.

       -ffactor <number>
              Resample the font alphamap.  Can be:
                 0    plain white fonts
                 0.75 very narrow black outline (default)
                 1    narrow black outline
                 10   bold black outline

       -flip-hebrew (FriBiDi only)
              Turns on flipping subtitles using FriBiDi.

       -noflip-hebrew-commas
              Change  FriBiDi’s  assumptions about the placements of commas in
              subtitles.  Use this if commas in subtitles  are  shown  at  the
              start of a sentence instead of at the end.

       -font <path to font.desc file>
              Search  for  the  OSD/SUB fonts in an alternative directory (de‐
              fault for normal fonts: ~/.mplayer/font/font.desc,  default  for
              FreeType fonts: ~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf).
              NOTE: With FreeType, this option determines the path to the text
              font file.  With fontconfig, this option determines the fontcon‐
              fig font name.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -font ~/.mplayer/arial-14/font.desc
                 -font ~/.mplayer/arialuni.ttf
                 -font ’Bitstream Vera Sans’

       -fontconfig (fontconfig only)
              Enables the usage of fontconfig managed fonts.

       -forcedsubsonly
              Display  only  forced  subtitles for the DVD subtitle stream se‐
              lected by e.g. -slang.

       -fribidi-charset <charset name> (FriBiDi only)
              Specifies the character set that will be passed to FriBiDi  when
              decoding non-UTF-8 subtitles (default: ISO8859-8).

       -ifo <VOBsub IFO file>
              Indicate  the  file  that will be used to load palette and frame
              size for VOBsub subtitles.

       -noautosub
              Turns off automatic subtitle file loading.

       -osd-duration <time>
              Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms (default: 1000).

       -osdlevel <0-3> (MPlayer only)
              Specifies which mode the OSD should start in.
                 0    subtitles only
                 1    volume + seek (default)
                 2    volume + seek + timer + percentage
                 3    volume + seek + timer + percentage + total time

       -overlapsub
              Allows the next subtitle to be displayed while the  current  one
              is still visible (default is to enable the support only for spe‐
              cific formats).

       -sid <ID> (also see -slang, -vobsubid)
              Display the subtitle stream specified by <ID>  (0-31).   MPlayer
              prints the available subtitle IDs when run in verbose (-v) mode.
              If you cannot select one of the subtitles on  a  DVD,  also  try
              -vobsubid.

       -slang <language code[,language code,...]> (also see -sid)
              Specify a priority list of subtitle languages to use.  Different
              container formats employ different language codes.  DVDs use ISO
              639-1  two  letter language codes, Matroska uses ISO 639-2 three
              letter language codes while OGM  uses  a  free-form  identifier.
              MPlayer  prints the available languages when run in verbose (-v)
              mode.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer dvd://1 -slang hu,en
                      Chooses the Hungarian subtitle track on a DVD and  falls
                      back on English if Hungarian is not available.
                 mplayer -slang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file with Japanese subtitles.

       -spuaa <mode>
              Antialiasing/scaling  mode for DVD/VOBsub.  A value of 16 may be
              added to <mode> in order to force scaling even when original and
              scaled  frame  size already match.  This can be employed to e.g.
              smooth subtitles with gaussian blur.  Available modes are:
                 0    none (fastest, very ugly)
                 1    approximate (broken?)
                 2    full (slow)
                 3    bilinear (default, fast and not too bad)
                 4    uses swscaler gaussian blur (looks very good)

       -spualign <-1-2>
              Specify how SPU (DVD/VOBsub) subtitles should be aligned.
                 -1   original position
                  0   Align at top (original behavior, default).
                  1   Align at center.
                  2   Align at bottom.

       -spugauss <0.0-3.0>
              Variance parameter of gaussian used by -spuaa 4.   Higher  means
              more blur (default: 1.0).

       -sub <subtitlefile1,subtitlefile2,...>
              Use/display  these  subtitle  files.   Only one file can be dis‐
              played at the same time.

       -sub-bg-alpha <0-255>
              Specify the alpha channel value  for  subtitles  and  OSD  back‐
              grounds.  Big values mean more transparency.  0 means completely
              transparent.

       -sub-bg-color <0-255>
              Specify the color value for subtitles and OSD backgrounds.  Cur‐
              rently  subtitles  are  grayscale so this value is equivalent to
              the intensity of the color.  255 means white and 0 black.

       -sub-demuxer <[+]name> (-subfile only) (BETA CODE)
              Force subtitle demuxer type for -subfile.  Use a ’+’ before  the
              name  to force it, this will skip some checks!  Give the demuxer
              name as printed by -sub-demuxer help.  For backward compatibili‐
              ty it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in subreader.h.

       -sub-fuzziness <mode>
              Adjust matching fuzziness when searching for subtitles:
                 0    exact match
                 1    Load all subs containing movie name.
                 2    Load all subs in the current directory.

       -sub-no-text-pp
              Disables any kind of text post processing done after loading the
              subtitles.  Used for debug purposes.

       -subalign <0-2>
              Specify which edge of the subtitles should  be  aligned  at  the
              height given by -subpos.
                 0    Align subtitle top edge (original behavior).
                 1    Align subtitle center.
                 2    Align subtitle bottom edge (default).

       -subcc
              Display  DVD  Closed  Caption (CC) subtitles.  These are not the
              VOB subtitles, these are special ASCII subtitles for the hearing
              impaired  encoded  in  the  VOB userdata stream on most region 1
              DVDs.  CC subtitles have not been spotted on DVDs from other re‐
              gions so far.

       -subcp <codepage> (iconv only)
              If  your  system  supports  iconv(3), you can use this option to
              specify the subtitle codepage.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -subcp latin2
                 -subcp cp1250

       -subcp enca:<language>:<fallback codepage> (ENCA only)
              You can specify your language using a two letter  language  code
              to  make ENCA detect the codepage automatically.  If unsure, en‐
              ter anything and watch mplayer  -v  output  for  available  lan‐
              guages.   Fallback  codepage specifies the codepage to use, when
              autodetection fails.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -subcp enca:cs:latin2
                      Guess the encoding, assuming the  subtitles  are  Czech,
                      fall back on latin 2, if the detection fails.
                 -subcp enca:pl:cp1250
                      Guess the encoding for Polish, fall back on cp1250.

       -subdelay <sec>
              Delays subtitles by <sec> seconds.  Can be negative.

       -subfile <filename> (BETA CODE)
              Currently useless.  Same as -audiofile, but for subtitle streams
              (OggDS?).

       -subfont-autoscale <0-3> (FreeType only)
              Sets the autoscale mode.
              NOTE: 0 means that text scale and OSD scale are font heights  in
              points.

              The mode can be:

                 0    no autoscale
                 1    proportional to movie height
                 2    proportional to movie width
                 3    proportional to movie diagonal (default)

       -subfont-blur <0-8> (FreeType only)
              Sets the font blur radius (default: 2).

       -subfont-encoding <value> (FreeType only)
              Sets  the  font encoding.  When set to ’unicode’, all the glyphs
              from the font file will be rendered and  unicode  will  be  used
              (default: unicode).

       -subfont-osd-scale <0-100> (FreeType only)
              Sets the autoscale coefficient of the OSD elements (default: 6).

       -subfont-outline <0-8> (FreeType only)
              Sets the font outline thickness (default: 2).

       -subfont-text-scale <0-100> (FreeType only)
              Sets the subtitle text autoscale coefficient  as  percentage  of
              the screen size (default: 5).

       -subfps <rate>
              Specify the framerate of the subtitle file (default: movie fps).
              NOTE: Only for frame-based subtitle files, i.e. MicroDVD format.

       -subpos <0-100> (useful with -vf expand)
              Specify  the  position of subtitles on the screen.  The value is
              the vertical position of the subtitle in % of the screen height.

       -subwidth <10-100>
              Specify  the  maximum  width of subtitles on the screen.  Useful
              for TV-out.  The value is the width of the subtitle in % of  the
              screen width.

       -noterm-osd
              Disable the display of OSD messages on the console when no video
              output is available.

       -term-osd-esc <escape sequence>
              Specify the escape sequence to use before writing an OSD message
              on  the console.  The escape sequence should move the pointer to
              the beginning of the line used for the OSD  and  clear  it  (de‐
              fault: ^[[A\r^[[K).

       -unicode
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as unicode.

       -utf8
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as UTF-8.

       -vobsub <VOBsub file without extension>
              Specify  a VOBsub file to use for subtitles.  Has to be the full
              pathname without extension, i.e. without the ’.idx’,  ’.ifo’  or
              ’.sub’.

       -vobsubid <0-31>
              Specify the VOBsub subtitle ID.

AUDIO OUTPUT OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -abs <value> (-ao oss only) (OBSOLETE)
              Override audio driver/card buffer size detection.

       -format <format> (also see the format audio filter)
              Select  the  sample format used for output from the audio filter
              layer to the sound card.  The values that <format> can adopt are
              listed below in the description of the format audio filter.

       -mixer <device>
              Use  a  mixer device different from the default /dev/mixer.  For
              ALSA this is the mixer name.

       -mixer-channel <mixer line>[,mixer index] (-ao oss and -ao alsa only)
              This option will tell MPlayer to use  a  different  channel  for
              controlling  volume  than  the default PCM.  Options for OSS in‐
              clude vol, pcm, line.  For a complete list of options  look  for
              SOUND_DEVICE_NAMES  in /usr/include/linux/soundcard.h.  For ALSA
              you can use the names  e.g.  alsamixer  displays,  like  Master,
              Line, PCM.
              NOTE:  ALSA  mixer  channel  names  followed by a number must be
              specified in the <name,number> format, i.e.  a  channel  labeled
              ’PCM 1’ in alsamixer must be converted to PCM,1.

       -softvol
              Force  the use of the software mixer, instead of using the sound
              card mixer.

       -softvol-max <10.0-10000.0>
              Set the maximum amplification level in percent  (default:  110).
              A value of 200 will allow you to adjust the volume up to a maxi‐
              mum of double the current level.  With values below 100 the ini‐
              tial  volume  (which  is  100%) will be above the maximum, which
              e.g. the OSD cannot display correctly.

       -volstep <0-100>
              Set the step size of mixer volume  changes  in  percent  of  the
              whole range (default: 3).

AUDIO OUTPUT DRIVERS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       Audio  output  drivers are interfaces to different audio output facili‐
       ties.  The syntax is:

       -ao <driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ’,’ MPlayer will fall back  on  drivers  not
       contained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omit‐
       ted.
       NOTE: See -ao help for a list of compiled-in audio output drivers.

       EXAMPLE:
                 -ao alsa,oss,
                      Try the ALSA driver, then the OSS driver, then others.
                 -ao alsa:noblock:device=hw=0.3
                      Sets noblock-mode and the  device-name  as  first  card,
                      fourth device.

       Available audio output drivers are:

       alsa

       -fstype <type1,type2,...> (X11 only)
              Specify a priority list of fullscreen modes to be used.  You can
              negate  the modes by prefixing them with ’-’.  If you experience
              problems like the fullscreen window being covered by other  win‐
              dows try using a different order.
              NOTE: See -fstype help for a full list of available modes.

              The available types are:

                 above
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_ABOVE hint if available.
                 below
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_BELOW hint if available.
                 fullscreen
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_FULLSCREEN hint if available.
                 layer
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the default layer.
                 layer=<0...15>
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the given layer number.
                 netwm
                      Force NETWM style.
                 none
                      Do not set fullscreen window layer.
                 stays_on_top
                      Use _NETWM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP hint if available.

              EXAMPLE:
                 layer,stays_on_top,above,fullscreen
                      Default  order,  will be used as a fallback if incorrect
                      or unsupported modes are specified.
                 -fullscreen
                      Fixes fullscreen switching on OpenBox 1.x.

       -geometry x[%][:y[%]] or [WxH][+x+y]
              Adjust where the output is on the screen initially.  The x and y
              specifications  are  in pixels measured from the top-left of the
              screen to the top-left of the image being displayed, however  if
              a percentage sign is given after the argument it turns the value
              into a percentage of the screen size in that direction.  It also
              supports the standard X11 -geometry option format.  If an exter‐
              nal window is specified using the -wid option, then the x and  y
              coordinates  are  relative  to the top-left corner of the window
              rather than the screen.
              NOTE: This option is only supported by the x11, xmga, xv,  xvmc,
              xvidix, gl, gl2, directx and tdfxfb video output drivers.

              EXAMPLE:
                 50:40
                      Places the window at x=50, y=40.
                 50%:50%
                      Places the window in the middle of the screen.
                 100%
                      Places the window at the middle of the right edge of the
                      screen.
                 100%:100%
                      Places the window at the  bottom  right  corner  of  the
                      screen.

       -guiwid <window ID> (also see -wid) (GUI only)
              This tells the GUI to also use an X11 window and stick itself to
              the bottom of the video, which is useful to embed a mini-GUI  in
              a browser (with the MPlayer plugin for instance).

       -hue <-100-100>
              Adjust  the hue of the video signal (default: 0).  You can get a
              colored negative of the image with this option.   Not  supported
              by all video output drivers.

       -monitor-dotclock <range[,range,...]> (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the dotclock or pixelclock range of the monitor.

       -monitor-hfreq <range[,range,...]> (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the horizontal frequency range of the monitor.

       -monitor-vfreq <range[,range,...]> (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the vertical frequency range of the monitor.

       -monitoraspect <ratio> (also see -aspect)
              Set the aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen.  A value of 0
              disables a previous setting (e.g. in the  config  file).   Over‐
              rides the -monitorpixelaspect setting if enabled.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -monitoraspect 4:3  or 1.3333
                 -monitoraspect 16:9 or 1.7777

       -monitorpixelaspect <ratio> (also see -aspect)
              Set  the  aspect  of a single pixel of your monitor or TV screen
              (default: disabled).  A value of 1 means square pixels  (correct
              for (almost?) all LCDs).

       -nodouble
              Disables  double buffering, mostly for debugging purposes.  Dou‐
              ble buffering fixes flicker by storing two frames in memory, and
              displaying  one while decoding another.  It can affect OSD nega‐
              tively, but often removes OSD flickering.

       -nograbpointer
              Do not grab the mouse pointer after a video mode  change  (-vm).
              Useful for multihead setups.

       -nokeepaspect
              Do  not  keep  window  aspect ratio when resizing windows.  Only
              works with the x11,  xv,  xmga,  xvidix,  directx  video  output
              drivers.  Furthermore under X11 your window manager has to honor
              window aspect hints.

       -ontop
              Makes the player window stay on top of other windows.  Supported
              by  video  output  drivers which use X11, except SDL, as well as
              directx, macosx, quartz, ggi and gl2.

       -panscan <0.0-1.0>
              Enables pan-and-scan functionality (cropping the sides of e.g. a
              16:9  movie  to  make it fit a 4:3 display without black bands).
              The range controls how much of the image is cropped.  Only works
              with the xv, xmga, mga, gl, gl2, quartz, macosx and xvidix video
              output drivers.

       -panscanrange <-19.0-99.0> (experimental)
              Change the range of the pan-and-scan functionality (default: 1).
              Positive  values  mean multiples of the default range.  Negative
              numbers mean you can zoom in up to a factor of  -panscanrange+1.
              E.g.  -panscanrange  -3  allows  a zoom factor of up to 4.  This
              feature is experimental.  Do not report bugs unless you are  us‐
              ing -vo gl.

       -refreshrate <Hz>
              Set  the monitor refreshrate in Hz.  Currently only supported by
              -vo directx combined with the -vm option.

       -rootwin
              Play movie in the root  window  (desktop  background).   Desktop
              background  images  may  cover  the  movie window, though.  Only
              works with the x11, xv, xmga, xvidix, quartz, macosx and directx
              video output drivers.

       -saturation <-100-100>
              Adjust the saturation of the video signal (default: 0).  You can
              get grayscale output with this option.   Not  supported  by  all
              video output drivers.

       -screenh <pixels>
              Specify  the vertical screen resolution for video output drivers
              which do not know the screen  resolution  like  fbdev,  x11  and
              TVout.

       -screenw <pixels>
              Specify  the  horizontal  screen  resolution  for  video  output
              drivers which do not know the screen resolution like fbdev,  x11
              and TVout.

       -stop-xscreensaver (X11 only)
              Turns off xscreensaver at startup and turns it on again on exit.

       -vm
              Try to change to a different video mode.  Supported by the  dga,
              x11, xv, sdl and directx video output drivers.  If used with the
              directx video output driver the  -screenw,  -screenh,  -bpp  and
              -refreshrate options can be used to set the new display mode.

       -vsync
              Enables  VBI for the vesa, dfbmga and svga video output drivers.

       -wid <window ID> (also see -guiwid) (X11, OpenGL and DirectX only)
              This tells MPlayer to attach to an existing window.   Useful  to
              embed MPlayer in a browser (e.g. the plugger extension).

       -xineramascreen <-2-...> (X11 only)
              In  Xinerama  configurations  (i.e.  a single desktop that spans
              across multiple displays) this option tells MPlayer which screen
              to  display the movie on.  A value of -2 means fullscreen across
              the whole virtual display (in this case Xinerama information  is
              completely ignored), -1 means fullscreen on the display the win‐
              dow currently is on.  The initial position set via the -geometry
              option  is  relative to the specified screen.  Will usually only
              work with "-fstype -fullscreen" or "-fstype none".

       -zrbw (-vo zr only)
              Display in black and white.  For optimal performance,  this  can
              be combined with ’-lavdopts gray’.

       -zrcrop <[width]x[height]+[x offset]+[y offset]> (-vo zr only)
              Select  a  part  of  the input image to display, multiple occur‐
              rences of this option switch on cinerama mode.  In cinerama mode
              the  movie  is  distributed over more than one TV (or beamer) to
              create a larger image.  Options appearing after the n-th -zrcrop
              apply  to  the n-th MJPEG card, each card should at least have a
              -zrdev in addition to the -zrcrop.  For examples, see the output
              of -zrhelp and the Zr section of the documentation.

       -zrdev <device> (-vo zr only)
              Specify the device special file that belongs to your MJPEG card,
              by default the zr video output driver takes the first v4l device
              it can find.

       -zrfd (-vo zr only)
              Force  decimation:  Decimation,  as  specified  by  -zrhdec  and
              -zrvdec, only happens if the hardware scaler can stretch the im‐
              age  to its original size.  Use this option to force decimation.

       -zrhdec <1|2|4> (-vo zr only)
              Horizontal decimation: Ask the driver to send only every 2nd  or
              4th  line/pixel of the input image to the MJPEG card and use the
              scaler of the MJPEG card to stretch the image  to  its  original
              size.

       -zrhelp (-vo zr only)
              Display  a  list of all -zr* options, their default values and a
              cinerama mode example.

       -zrnorm <norm> (-vo zr only)
              Specify the TV norm as PAL or NTSC (default: no change).

       -zrquality <1-20> (-vo zr only)
              A number from 1 (best) to 20 (worst) representing the  JPEG  en‐
              coding quality.

       -zrvdec <1|2|4> (-vo zr only)
              Vertical  decimation:  Ask  the driver to send only every 2nd or
              4th line/pixel of the input image to the MJPEG card and use  the
              scaler  of  the  MJPEG card to stretch the image to its original
              size.

       -zrxdoff <x display offset> (-vo zr only)
              If the movie is smaller than the TV screen, this  option  speci‐
              fies  the  x  offset from the upper-left corner of the TV screen
              (default: centered).

       -zrydoff <y display offset> (-vo zr only)
              If the movie is smaller than the TV screen, this  option  speci‐
              fies  the  y  offset from the upper-left corner of the TV screen
              (default: centered).

VIDEO OUTPUT DRIVERS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       Video output drivers are interfaces to different video  output  facili‐
       ties.  The syntax is:

       -vo <driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If  the  list  has a trailing ’,’ MPlayer will fall back on drivers not
       contained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omit‐
       ted.
       NOTE: See -vo help for a list of compiled-in video output drivers.

       EXAMPLE:
                 -vo xmga,xv,
                      Try the Matrox X11 driver, then the Xv driver, then oth‐
                      ers.
                 -vo directx:noaccel
                      Uses  the  DirectX  driver  with  acceleration  features
                      turned off.

       Available video output drivers are:

       xv (X11 only)
              Uses  the XVideo extension of XFree86 4.x to enable hardware ac‐
              celerated playback.  If you cannot use a hardware specific driv‐
              er,  this  is  probably  the best option.  For information about
              what colorkey is used and how it is drawn run  MPlayer  with  -v
              option and look out for the lines tagged with [xv common] at the
              beginning.
                 port=<number>
                      Select a specific XVideo port.
                 ck=<cur|use|set>
                      Select the source from which the colorkey is taken  (de‐
                      fault: cur).
                         cur  The  default takes the colorkey currently set in
                              Xv.
                         use  Use but do not set  the  colorkey  from  MPlayer
                              (use -colorkey option to change it).
                         set  Same as use but also sets the supplied colorkey.
                 ck-method=<man|bg|auto>
                      Sets the colorkey drawing method (default: man).
                         man  Draw the colorkey manually (reduces  flicker  in
                              some cases).
                         bg   Set the colorkey as window background.
                         auto Let Xv draw the colorkey.

       x11 (X11 only)
              Shared  memory video output driver without hardware acceleration
              that works whenever X11 is present.

       xover (X11 only)
              Adds X11 support to all  overlay  based  video  output  drivers.
              Currently only supported by tdfx_vid.
                 <vo_driver>
                      Select  the driver to use as source to overlay on top of
                      X11.

       xvmc (X11 with -vc ffmpeg12mc only)
              Video output driver that uses the XvMC (X Video Motion Compensa‐
              tion) extension of XFree86 4.x to speed up MPEG-1/2 and VCR2 de‐
              coding.
                 port=<number>
                      Select a specific XVideo port.
                 (no)benchmark
                      Disables image display.  Necessary for proper benchmark‐
                      ing  of drivers that change image buffers on monitor re‐
                      trace only (nVidia).  Default is not  to  disable  image
                      display (nobenchmark).
                 (no)bobdeint
                      Very  simple  deinterlacer.   Might not look better than
                      -vf tfields=1, but it is the only deinterlacer for  xvmc
                      (default: nobobdeint).
                 (no)queue
                      Queue  frames for display to allow more parallel work of
                      the video hardware.  May add a  small  (not  noticeable)
                      constant A/V desync (default: noqueue).
                 (no)sleep
                      Use sleep function while waiting for rendering to finish
                      (not recommended on Linux) (default: nosleep).
                 ck=cur|use|set
                      Same as -vo xv:ck (see -vo xv).
                 ck-method=man|bg|auto
                      Same as -vo xv:ck-method (see -vo xv).

       dga (X11 only)
              Play video through the XFree86 Direct Graphics Access extension.
              Considered obsolete.

       sdl (SDL only)
              Highly  platform  independent SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) li‐
              brary video output driver.  Since SDL uses its  own  X11  layer,
              MPlayer X11 options do not have any effect on SDL.
                 driver=<driver>
                      Explicitly choose the SDL driver to use.
                 (no)forcexv
                      Use XVideo through the sdl video output driver (default:
                      forcexv).
                 (no)hwaccel
                      Use hardware accelerated scaler (default: hwaccel).

       vidix
              VIDIX (VIDeo Interface for *niX) is an interface  to  the  video
              acceleration  features  of  different graphics cards.  Very fast
              video output driver on cards that support it.
                 <subdevice>
                      Explicitly choose the VIDIX  subdevice  driver  to  use.
                      Available  subdevice  drivers  are  cyberblade,  mach64,
                      mga_crtc2,  mga,  nvidia,  pm2,  pm3,  radeon,  rage128,
                      sis_vid and unichrome.

       xvidix (X11 only)
              X11 frontend for VIDIX
                 <subdevice>
                      same as vidix

       cvidix
              Generic and platform independent VIDIX frontend, can even run in
              a text console with nVidia cards.
                 <subdevice>
                      same as vidix

       winvidix (Windows only)
              Windows frontend for VIDIX
                 <subdevice>
                      same as vidix

       directx (Windows only)

                 noaccel
                      Turns off hardware acceleration.  Try this option if you
                      have display problems.

       quartz (Mac OS X only)
              Mac  OS X Quartz video output driver.  Under some circumstances,
              it might be more efficient to force a packed YUV output  format,
              with e.g. -vf format=yuy2.
                 device_id=<number>
                      Choose the display device to use in fullscreen.
                 fs_res=<width>:<height>
                      Specify  the  fullscreen resolution (useful on slow sys‐
                      tems).

       macosx (Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.3.9 with QuickTime 7)
              Mac OS X CoreVideo video output driver
                 device_id=<number>

       fbdev (Linux only)
              Uses the kernel framebuffer to play video.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the fbdev device  name  to  use  (e.g.
                      /dev/fb0)  or the name of the VIDIX subdevice if the de‐
                      vice name starts with ’vidix’ (e.g.  ’vidixsis_vid’  for
                      the sis driver).

       fbdev2 (Linux only)
              Uses the kernel framebuffer to play video, alternative implemen‐
              tation.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the fbdev device name to use (default:
                      /dev/fb0).

       vesa
              Very  general  video  output driver that should work on any VESA
              VBE 2.0 compatible card.
                 (no)dga
                      Turns DGA mode on or off (default: on).
                 neotv_pal
                      Activate the NeoMagic TV out and set it to PAL norm.
                 neotv_ntsc
                      Activate the NeoMagic TV out and set it to NTSC norm.
                 vidix
                      Use the VIDIX driver.
                 lvo:
                      Activate the Linux Video Overlay on top of VESA mode.

       svga
              Play video using the SVGA library.
                 <video mode>
                      Specify video mode to use.  The mode can be given  in  a
                      <width>x<height>x<colors> format, e.g. 640x480x16M or be
                      a graphics mode number, e.g. 84.
                 bbosd
                      Draw OSD into black bands below the movie (slower).
                 native
                      Use only native drawing functions.  This  avoids  direct
                      rendering, OSD and hardware acceleration.
                 retrace
                      Force  frame  switch  on  vertical retrace.  Usable only
                      with -double.  It has the same effect as the -vsync  op‐
                      tion.
                 sq
                      Try to select a video mode with square pixels.
                 vidix
                      Use svga with VIDIX.

       gl
              OpenGL  video output driver, simple version.  Video size must be
              smaller than the maximum texture size of your OpenGL implementa‐
              tion.   Intended  to work even with the most basic OpenGL imple‐
              mentations, but also makes use of newer extensions, which  allow
              support  for  more colorspaces and direct rendering.  Please use
              -dr if it works with your OpenGL implementation, since for high‐
              er  resolutions  this provides a big speedup.  The code performs
              very few checks, so if a feature does not work,  this  might  be
              because  it  is not supported by your card/OpenGL implementation
              even if you do not get any error message.  Use glxinfo or a sim‐
              ilar tool to display the supported OpenGL extensions.
                 (no)scaled-osd
                      Changes  the  way  the  OSD behaves when the size of the
                      window changes (default: disabled).   When  enabled  be‐
                      haves more like the other video output drivers, which is
                      better for fixed-size fonts.  Disabled looks much better
                      with  FreeType  fonts and uses the borders in fullscreen
                      mode.  Does not work correctly with ass  subtitles  (see
                      -ass),  you  can instead render them without OpenGL sup‐
                      port via -vf ass.
                 osdcolor=<0xRRGGBB>
                      Color for OSD (default: 0xffffff, corresponds to white).
                 rectangle=<0,1,2>
                      Select  usage  of rectangular textures which saves video
                      RAM, but often is slower (default: 0).
                         0: Use power-of-two textures (default).
                         1: Use the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension.
                         2: Use the GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extension.
                         In  some  cases  only  supported in software and thus
                         very slow.
                 swapinterval=<n>
                      Minimum interval between two buffer  swaps,  counted  in
                      displayed  frames  (default: 1).  1 is equivalent to en‐
                      abling VSYNC, 0 to disabling VSYNC.  Values below 0 will
                      leave it at the system default.  This limits the framer‐
                      ate  to  (horizontal  refresh  rate  /   n).    Requires
                      GLX_SGI_swap_control   support   to   work.   With  some
                      (most/all?)   implementations   this   only   works   in
                      fullscreen mode.
                 yuv=<n>
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.
                         0:  Use  software  conversion  (default).  Compatible
                         with all OpenGL versions.  Provides brightness,  con‐
                         trast and saturation control.
                         1:  Use register combiners.  This uses an nVidia-spe‐
                         cific extension (GL_NV_register_combiners).  At least
                         three  texture units are needed.  Provides saturation
                         and hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         2: Use a fragment program.   Needs  the  GL_ARB_frag‐
                         ment_program  extension  and  at  least three texture
                         units.  Provides brightness, contrast, saturation and
                         hue control.
                         3:  Use a fragment program using the POW instruction.
                         Needs the GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension  and  at
                         least three texture units.  Provides brightness, con‐
                         trast, saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma  can
                         also  be  set  independently for red, green and blue.
                         Method 4 is usually faster.
                         4: Use a fragment  program  with  additional  lookup.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension and at
                         least four texture units.  Provides brightness,  con‐
                         trast,  saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma can
                         also be set independently for red, green and blue.
                         5: Use ATI-specific method (for older  cards).   This
                         uses an ATI-specific extension (GL_ATI_fragment_shad‐
                         er - not GL_ARB_fragment_shader!).   At  least  three
                         texture  units  are  needed.  Provides saturation and
                         hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         6: Use a 3D texture  to  do  conversion  via  lookup.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension and at
                         least four texture units.  Extremely  slow  (software
                         emulation)  on  some (all?) ATI cards since it uses a
                         texture with  border  pixels.   Provides  brightness,
                         contrast,  saturation,  hue and gamma control.  Gamma
                         can also be set  independently  for  red,  green  and
                         blue.   Speed  depends  more  on GPU memory bandwidth
                         than other methods.
                 lscale=<n>
                      Select the scaling function to use for  luminance  scal‐
                      ing.  Only valid for yuv modes 2, 3, 4 and 6.
                         0: Use simple linear filtering (default).
                         1: Use bicubic filtering (better quality).  Needs one
                         additional texture unit.  Older  cards  will  not  be
                         able to handle this for chroma at least in fullscreen
                         mode.
                         2: Use cubic filtering in horizontal, linear  filter‐
                         ing in vertical direction.  Works on a few more cards
                         than method 1.
                 cscale=<n>
                      Select the scaling function to use for chrominance scal‐
                      ing.  For details see lscale.
                 customprog=<filename>
                      Load  a  custom  fragment  program from <filename>.  See
                      TOOLS/edgedect.fp for an example.
                 customtex=<filename>
                      Load a custom  "gamma  ramp"  texture  from  <filename>.
                      This  can  be used in combination with yuv=4 or with the
                      customprog option.
                 (no)customtlin
                      If enabled (default) use GL_LINEAR interpolation, other‐
                      wise use GL_NEAREST for customtex texture.
                 (no)customtrect
                      If enabled, use texture_rectangle for customtex texture.
                      Default is disabled.

              Normally there is no reason to use the following  options,  they
              mostly exist for testing purposes.

                 (no)glfinish
                      Call  glFinish() before swapping buffers.  Slower but in
                      some cases more correct output (default: disabled).
                 (no)manyfmts
                      Enables support for more (RGB  and  BGR)  color  formats
                      (default: enabled).  Needs OpenGL version >= 1.2.
                 slice-height=<0-...>
                      Number of lines copied to texture in one piece (default:
                      4).  0 for whole image.
                      NOTE: If YUV colorspace is  used  (see  yuv  suboption),
                      special rules apply:
                         If  the decoder uses slice rendering (see -noslices),
                         this setting has no effect, the size of the slices as
                         provided by the decoder is used.
                         If  the decoder does not use slice rendering, the de‐
                         fault is 16.
                 (no)osd
                      Enable or disable support for OSD rendering  via  OpenGL
                      (default: enabled).  This option is for testing; to dis‐
                      able the OSD use -osdlevel 0 instead.
                 (no)aspect
                      Enable or disable aspect scaling and  pan-and-scan  sup‐
                      port   (default:  enabled).   Disabling  might  increase
                      speed.

       gl2
              OpenGL video output driver, second generation.  Supports OSD and
              videos larger than the maximum texture size.
                 (no)glfinish
                      same as gl (default: enabled)
                 yuv=<n>
                      Select  the  type  of  YUV to RGB conversion.  If set to
                      anything except 0 OSD will be disabled  and  brightness,
                      contrast  and  gamma  setting  is only available via the
                      global X server settings.  Apart from  this  the  values
                      have the same meaning as for -vo gl.

       null
              Produces no video output.  Useful for benchmarking.

       aa
              ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.  You
              can get a list and an explanation of available  suboptions  exe‐
              cuting mplayer -vo aa:help

       caca
              Color  ASCII  art  video output driver that works on a text con‐
              sole.

       bl
              Video playback using the Blinkenlights UDP protocol.  This driv‐
              er is highly hardware specific.
                 <subdevice>
                      Explicitly  choose the Blinkenlights subdevice driver to
                      use.  It is something like arcade:host=localhost:2323 or
                      hdl:file=name1,file=name2.   You  must  specify a subde‐
                      vice.

       ggi
              GGI graphics system video output driver
                 <driver>
                      Explicitly choose the GGI driver to  use.   Replace  any
                      ’,’ that would appear in the driver string by a ’.’.

       directfb
              Play video using the DirectFB library.
                 (no)input
                      Use  the  DirectFB  instead of the MPlayer keyboard code
                      (default: enabled).
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      Double and triple buffering give  best  results  if  you
                      want  to avoid tearing issues.  Triple buffering is more
                      efficient than double buffering as  it  does  not  block
                      MPlayer  while waiting for the vertical retrace.  Single
                      buffering should be avoided (default: single).
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      Control the output order for interlaced frames (default:
                      disabled).   Valid  values  are  top = top fields first,
                      bottom = bottom fields first.  This option does not have
                      any  effect  on progressive film material like most MPEG
                      movies are.  You need to enable this option if you  have
                      tearing  issues  or unsmooth motions watching interlaced
                      film material.
                 layer=N
                      Will force layer with ID N for playback (default:  -1  -
                      auto).
                 dfbopts=<list>
                      Specify a parameter list for DirectFB.

       dfbmga
              Matrox G400/G450/G550 specific video output driver that uses the
              DirectFB library to make use of special hardware features.   En‐
              ables CRTC2 (second head), displaying video independently of the
              first head.
                 (no)input
                      same as directfb (default: disabled)
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      same as directfb (default: triple)
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      same as directfb
                 (no)bes
                      Enable the use of the Matrox BES (backend  scaler)  (de‐
                      fault:  disabled).   Gives  very good results concerning
                      speed and output quality as  interpolated  picture  pro‐
                      cessing  is done in hardware.  Works only on the primary
                      head.
                 (no)spic
                      Make use of the Matrox sub picture layer to display  the
                      OSD (default: enabled).
                 (no)crtc2
                      Turn  on  TV-out  on the second head (default: enabled).
                      The output quality is amazing as it is a full interlaced
                      picture with proper sync to every odd/even field.
                 tvnorm=pal|ntsc|auto
                      Will set the TV norm of the Matrox card without the need
                      for  modifying  /etc/directfbrc   (default:   disabled).
                      Valid norms are pal = PAL, ntsc = NTSC.  Special norm is
                      auto (auto-adjust using  PAL/NTSC)  because  it  decides
                      which  norm  to  use  by looking at the framerate of the
                      movie.

       mga (Linux only)
              Matrox specific video output driver that makes use  of  the  YUV
              back  end  scaler on Gxxx cards through a kernel module.  If you
              have a Matrox card, this is the fastest option.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the Matrox device  name  to  use  (de‐
                      fault: /dev/mga_vid).

                 <device>
                      Explicitly  choose  the  Matrox  device name to use (de‐
                      fault: /dev/mga_vid).

       syncfb
              Video output driver for the SyncFB kernel module, which provides
              special  hardware  features  of  Matrox Gxxx cards like hardware
              deinterlacing, scaling and synchronizing your  video  output  to
              the vertical retrace of your monitor.

       s3fb (Linux only) (see also -vf yuv2 and -dr)
              S3 Virge specific video output driver.  This driver supports the
              card’s YUV conversion and scaling, double buffering  and  direct
              rendering  features.   Use  -vf yuy2 to get hardware-accelerated
              YUY2 rendering, which is much faster than YV12 on this card.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the fbdev device name to use (default:
                      /dev/fb0).

       3dfx (Linux only)
              3dfx-specific  video  output driver that directly uses the hard‐
              ware on top of X11.  Only 16 bpp are supported.

       tdfxfb (Linux only)
              This driver employs the tdfxfb framebuffer driver to play movies
              with YUV acceleration on 3dfx cards.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the fbdev device name to use (default:
                      /dev/fb0).

       tdfx_vid (Linux only)
              3dfx-specific video output driver that works in combination with
              the tdfx_vid kernel module.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the device name to use (default: /dev/
                      tdfx_vid).

       dxr2 (also see -dxr2) (DXR2 only)
              Creative DXR2 specific video output driver.
                 <vo_driver>

              signs  Hollywood  Plus)  specific video output driver.  Also see
              the lavc video filter.
                 overlay
                      Activates the overlay instead of TVOut.
                 prebuf
                      Turns on prebuffering.
                 sync
                      Will turn on the new sync-engine.
                 norm=<norm>
                      Specifies the TV norm.
                         0: Does not change current norm (default).
                         1: Auto-adjust using PAL/NTSC.

              (i.e. not interlaced).

       gif89a
              Output each frame into a single animated GIF file in the current
              directory.  It supports only RGB format with 24 bpp and the out‐
              put is converted to 256 colors.
                 <fps>
                      Float value to specify framerate (default: 5.0).
                 <output>
                      Specify the output filename (default: ./out.gif).

              NOTE: You must specify the framerate before the filename or  the

       pnm
              Output  each  frame  into  a  PNM file in the current directory.
              Each file takes the frame number padded with  leading  zeros  as
              name.   It  supports  PPM,  PGM and PGMYUV files in both raw and
              ASCII mode.  Also see pnm(5), ppm(5) and pgm(5).
                 ppm

                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify the directory to save the PNM files to (default:
                      ./).
                 subdirs=<prefix>
                      Create numbered subdirectories with the specified prefix
                      to save the files in instead of the current directory.
                 maxfiles=<value>
                      Maximum number of files to be  saved  per  subdirectory.
                      Must be equal to or larger than 1 (default: 1000).

                 z=<0-9>
                      Specifies the compression level.  0 is no compression, 9
                      is maximum compression.

       tga
              Output each frame into a Targa file in  the  current  directory.
              Each  file  takes  the frame number padded with leading zeros as
              name.  The purpose of this video output driver is to have a sim‐
              ple  lossless  image writer to use without any external library.
              It supports the BGR[A] color format, with 15,  24  and  32  bpp.
              You  can force a particular format with the format video filter.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer video.nut -vf format=bgr15 -vo tga

DECODING/FILTERING OPTIONS
       -ac <[-|+]codec1,[-|+]codec2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of audio codecs to be used, according to
              their  codec  name  in  codecs.conf.  Use a ’-’ before the codec
              name to omit it.  Use a ’+’ before the codec name to  force  it,
              this  will likely crash!  If the list has a trailing ’,’ MPlayer
              will fall back on codecs not contained in the list.
              NOTE: See -ac help for a full list of available codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ac mp3acm
                      Force the l3codeca.acm MP3 codec.
                 -ac mad,
                      Try libmad first, then fall back on others.
                 -ac hwac3,a52,
                      Try hardware AC3 passthrough, software AC3, then others.
                 -ac hwdts,
                      Try  hardware DTS passthrough, then fall back on others.
                 -ac -ffmp3,
                      Skip FFmpeg’s MP3 decoder.

       -af-adv <force=(0-7):list=(filters)> (also see -af)

                         1: Optimize for accuracy (default).
                         2: Optimize for speed.  Warning: Some features in the
                         audio filters may silently fail, and the sound quali‐
                         ty may drop.
                         3: Use no automatic insertion of filters and no opti‐
                         mization.  Warning:  It  may  be  possible  to  crash
                         MPlayer using this setting.
                         4:  Use automatic insertion of filters according to 0
                         above, but use floating point processing when  possi‐
                         ble.
                         5:  Use automatic insertion of filters according to 1
                         above, but use floating point processing when  possi‐
                         ble.
                         6:  Use automatic insertion of filters according to 2
                         above, but use floating point processing when  possi‐
                         ble.
                         7: Use no automatic insertion of filters according to
                         3 above, and use floating point processing when  pos‐
                         sible.

              Specify  a priority list of audio codec families to be used, ac‐
              cording to their codec name in codecs.conf.  Falls back  on  the
              default codecs if none of the given codec families work.
              NOTE: See -afm help for a full list of available codec families.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -afm ffmpeg

              -vo xvmc:bobdeint.
                 -1   auto  (default):  If the decoder does not export the ap‐
                      propriate information, it falls back  to  0  (top  field
                      first).
                 0    top field first
                 1    bottom field first

       -flip
              Flip image upside-down.

       -lavdopts <option1:option2:...> (DEBUG CODE)

                         3:  aggressive (More checks, but might cause problems
                         even for valid bitstreams.)
                         4: very aggressive

                 fast (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and H.264 only)
                      Enable optimizations which do not comply to the specifi‐
                      cation  and  might potentially cause problems, like sim‐
                      pler dequantization, simpler motion compensation, assum‐
                      ing use of the default quantization matrix, assuming YUV
                      4:2:0 and skipping a few checks to detect  damaged  bit‐
                      streams.

                 gray
                      grayscale only decoding (a bit faster than with color)

                 idct=<0-99> (see -lavcopts)
                      For  best  decoding  quality use the same IDCT algorithm
                      for decoding and encoding.  This may come at a price  in
                      accuracy, though.

                 lowres=<number>[,<w>]
                      Decode at lower resolutions.  Low resolution decoding is
                      not supported by all codecs, and it will often result in
                      ugly artifacts.  This is not a bug, but a side effect of
                      not decoding at full resolution.
                         0: disabled
                         1: 1/2 resolution
                         2: 1/4 resolution
                         3: 1/8 resolution
                      If <w> is specified lowres decoding will be used only if
                      the width of the video is major than or equal to <w>.

                 sb=<number> (MPEG-2 only)
                      Skip  the given number of macroblock rows at the bottom.

                 st=<number> (MPEG-2 only)
                      Skip the given number of macroblock rows at the top.

                 skiploopfilter=<skipvalue>
                      Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264  de‐
                      coding.  Since the filtered frame is supposed to be used
                      as reference for decoding dependent frames  this  has  a
                      worse  effect  on  quality  than not doing deblocking on
                      e.g. MPEG-2 video.  But at least for high  bitrate  HDTV
                      this  provides  a  big  speedup  with no visible quality
                      loss.

                      <skipvalue> can be either one of the following:
                         none: Never skip.
                         default: Skip useless processing steps (e.g.  0  size
                         packets in AVI).
                         nonref: Skip frames that are not referenced (i.e. not
                         used for decoding  other  frames,  the  error  cannot
                         "build up").
                         bidir: Skip B-Frames.
                         nonkey: Skip all frames except keyframes.
                         all: Skip all frames.

                 skipidct=<skipvalue> (MPEG-1/2 only)
                      Skips  the IDCT step.  This degrades quality a lot of in
                      almost all cases (see skiploopfilter for available  skip
                      values).

                 skipframe=<skipvalue>
                      Skips  decoding  of frames completely.  Big speedup, but
                      jerky motion and sometimes bad artifacts (see  skiploop‐
                      filter for available skip values).

                 threads=<1-8> (MPEG-1/2 only)
                      number of threads to use for decoding (default: 1)

                 vismv=<value>
                      Visualize motion vectors.
                         0: disabled
                         1: Visualize forward predicted MVs of P-frames.
                         2: Visualize forward predicted MVs of B-frames.
                         4: Visualize backward predicted MVs of B-frames.

                 vstats
                      Prints   some   statistics  and  stores  them  in  ./vs‐
                      tats_*.log.

       -noslices
              Disable drawing video by 16-pixel height  slices/bands,  instead
              draws the whole frame in a single run.  May be faster or slower,
              depending on video card and available cache.  It has effect only
              with libmpeg2 and libavcodec codecs.

       -nosound
              Do not play/encode sound.  Useful for benchmarking.

       -novideo
              Do not play/encode video.  In many cases this will not work, use
              -vc null -vo null instead.

       -pp <quality> (also see -vf pp)
              Set the DLL postprocess level.  This option is no longer  usable
              with  -vf pp.  It only works with Win32 DirectShow DLLs with in‐
              ternal postprocessing routines.  The valid range of  -pp  values
              varies  by  codec, it is mostly 0-6, where 0=disable, 6=slowest/
              best.

       -pphelp (also see -vf pp)
              Show a summary about the available postprocess filters and their
              usage.

       -ssf <mode>
              Specifies software scaler parameters.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vf scale -ssf lgb=3.0
                 lgb=<0-100>
                      gaussian blur filter (luma)
                 cgb=<0-100>
                      gaussian blur filter (chroma)
                 ls=<-100-100>
                      sharpen filter (luma)
                 cs=<-100-100>
                      sharpen filter (chroma)
                 chs=<h>
                      chroma horizontal shifting
                 cvs=<v>
                      chroma vertical shifting

       -stereo <mode>
              Select type of MP2/MP3 stereo output.
                 0    stereo
                 1    left channel
                 2    right channel

       -sws <software scaler type> (also see -vf scale and -zoom)
              Specify  the software scaler algorithm to be used with the -zoom
              option.  This affects video output drivers which  lack  hardware
              acceleration, e.g. x11.

              Available types are:

                 0    fast bilinear
                 1    bilinear
                 2    bicubic (good quality) (default)
                 3    experimental
                 4    nearest neighbor (bad quality)
                 5    area
                 6    luma bicubic / chroma bilinear
                 7    gauss
                 8    sincR
                 9    lanczos
                 10   natural bicubic spline

              NOTE:  Some  -sws  options  are tunable.  The description of the
              scale video filter has further information.

       -vc <[-|+]codec1,[-|+]codec2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of video codecs to be used, according to
              their  codec  name  in  codecs.conf.  Use a ’-’ before the codec
              name to omit it.  Use a ’+’ before the codec name to  force  it,
              this  will likely crash!  If the list has a trailing ’,’ MPlayer
              will fall back on codecs not contained in the list.
              NOTE: See -vc help for a full list of available codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vc divx
                      Force Win32/VfW DivX codec, no fallback.
                 -vc -divxds,-divx,
                      Skip Win32 DivX codecs.
                 -vc ffmpeg12,mpeg12,
                      Try libavcodec’s MPEG-1/2  codec,  then  libmpeg2,  then
                      others.

       -vfm <driver1,driver2,...>
              Specify  a priority list of video codec families to be used, ac‐
              cording to their names in codecs.conf.  Falls back  on  the  de‐
              fault codecs if none of the given codec families work.
              NOTE: See -vfm help for a full list of available codec families.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vfm ffmpeg,dshow,vfw
                      Try the libavcodec, then Directshow, then VfW codecs and
                      fall back on others, if they do not work.
                 -vfm xanim
                      Try XAnim codecs first.

       -x <x> (also see -zoom) (MPlayer only)
              Scale image to width <x> (if software/hardware scaling is avail‐
              able).  Disables aspect calculations.

       -xvidopts <option1:option2:...>
              Specify additional parameters when decoding with Xvid.
              NOTE: Since libavcodec is faster than Xvid you might want to use
              the  libavcodec postprocessing filter (-vf pp) and decoder (-vfm
              ffmpeg) instead.

              Xvid’s internal postprocessing filters:
                 deblock-chroma
                      chroma deblock filter
                 deblock-luma
                      luma deblock filter
                 dering-luma
                      luma deringing filter
                 dering-chroma
                      chroma deringing filter
                 filmeffect
                      Adds artificial film grain to the video.   May  increase
                      perceived quality, while lowering true quality.

              rendering methods:
                 dr2
                      Activate direct rendering method 2.
                 nodr2
                      Deactivate direct rendering method 2.

       -xy <value> (also see -zoom)
                 value<=8
                      Scale image by factor <value>.
                 value>8
                      Set  width to value and calculate height to keep correct
                      aspect ratio.

       -y <y> (also see -zoom) (MPlayer only)
              Scale image to  height  <y>  (if  software/hardware  scaling  is
              available).  Disables aspect calculations.

       -zoom
              Allow  software scaling, where available.  This will allow scal‐
              ing with output drivers (like x11, fbdev) that  do  not  support
              hardware  scaling  where MPlayer disables scaling by default for
              performance reasons.

AUDIO FILTERS
       Audio filters allow you to modify the audio stream and its  properties.
       The syntax is:

       -af <filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...>
              Setup a chain of audio filters.

       NOTE: To get a full list of available audio filters, see -af help.

       Available filters are:

       resample[=srate[:sloppy[:type]]]
              Changes the sample rate of the audio stream.  Can be used if you
              have a fixed frequency sound card or if you are  stuck  with  an
              old sound card that is only capable of max 44.1kHz.  This filter
              is automatically enabled if necessary.  It only supports  16-bit
              integer and float in native-endian format as input.
              NOTE: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate <srate>.
                 <srate>
                      output sample frequency in Hz.  The valid range for this
                      parameter is 8000 to 192000.  If the  input  and  output
                      sample  frequency  are  the same or if this parameter is
                      omitted the filter is automatically  unloaded.   A  high
                      sample  frequency  normally  improves the audio quality,
                      especially when used in combination with other  filters.
                 <sloppy>
                      Allow (1) or disallow (0) the output frequency to differ
                      slightly from the frequency given by  <srate>  (default:
                      1).   Can  be used if the startup of the playback is ex‐
                      tremely slow.
                 <type>
                      Selects which resampling method to use.
                         0: linear interpolation (fast, poor quality especial‐
                         ly when upsampling)
                         1: polyphase filterbank and integer processing
                         2: polyphase filterbank and floating point processing
                         (slow, best quality)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af resample=44100:0:0
                      would set the output frequency of the resample filter to
                      44100Hz  using exact output frequency scaling and linear
                      interpolation.

       lavcresample[=srate[:length[:linear[:count[:cutoff]]]]]
              Changes the sample rate  of  the  audio  stream  to  an  integer
              <srate>  in  Hz.  It only supports the 16-bit native-endian for‐
              mat.
              NOTE: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate <srate>.
                 <srate>
                      the output sample rate
                 <length>
                      length of the filter with respect to the lower  sampling
                      rate (default: 16)
                 <linear>
                      if  1 then filters will be linearly interpolated between
                      polyphase entries
                 <count>
                      log2 of the number of polyphase entries (...,  10->1024,
                      11->2048, 12->4096, ...)  (default: 10->1024)
                 <cutoff>
                      cutoff  frequency  (0.0-1.0), default set depending upon
                      filter length

       sweep[=speed]
              Produces a sine sweep.
                 <0.0-1.0>
                      Sine function delta, use very low  values  to  hear  the
                      sweep.

       sinesuppress[=freq:decay]
              Remove  a sine at the specified frequency.  Useful to get rid of
              the 50/60Hz noise on low quality audio equipment.   It  probably
              only works on mono input.
                 <freq>
                      The  frequency  of  the sine which should be removed (in
                      Hz) (default: 50)
                 <decay>
                      Controls the adaptivity (a larger value  will  make  the
                      filter  adapt  to amplitude and phase changes quicker, a
                      smaller value will make the adaptation slower) (default:
                      0.0001).  Reasonable values are around 0.001.

       hrtf[=flag]
              Head-related transfer function: Converts multichannel audio to 2
              channel output for headphones, preserving the spatiality of  the
              sound.

       equalizer=[g1:g2:g3:...:g10]
              10  octave band graphic equalizer, implemented using 10 IIR band
              pass filters.  This means that it works regardless of what  type
              of  audio  is being played back.  The center frequencies for the
              10 bands are:

              No. frequency
              0    31.25 Hz
              1    62.50 Hz

              If the sample rate of the sound being played is lower  than  the
              center  frequency  for  a frequency band, then that band will be
              disabled.  A known bug with this filter is that the characteris‐
              tics  for the uppermost band are not completely symmetric if the
              sample rate is close to the center frequency of that band.  This
              problem  can  be worked around by upsampling the sound using the
              resample filter before it reaches this filter.
                 <g1>:<g2>:<g3>:...:<g10>
                      floating point numbers representing the gain in  dB  for
                      each frequency band (-12-12)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af equalizer=11:11:10:5:0:-12:0:5:12:12 media.avi
                      Would amplify the sound in the upper and lower frequency
                      region while canceling it almost completely around 1kHz.

       channels=nch[:nr:from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...]
              Can  be  used  for  adding,  removing, routing and copying audio
              channels.  If only <nch> is given the default routing  is  used,
              it  works as follows: If the number of output channels is bigger
              than the number of input channels empty  channels  are  inserted
              (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono channel is re‐
              peated in both of the output channels).  If the number of output
              channels  is  smaller  than the number of input channels the ex‐
              ceeding channels are truncated.
                 <nch>
                      number of output channels (1-6)
                 <nr>
                      number of routes (1-6)
                 <from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...>
                      Pairs of numbers between 0 and 5 that  define  where  to
                      route each channel.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af channels=4:4:0:1:1:0:2:2:3:3 media.avi
                      Would  change  the  number of channels to 4 and set up 4
                      routes that swap channel 0 and channel 1 and leave chan‐
                      nel  2  and  3 intact.  Observe that if media containing
                      two channels was played back, channels  2  and  3  would
                      contain silence but 0 and 1 would still be swapped.
                 mplayer -af channels=6:4:0:0:0:1:0:2:0:3 media.avi
                      Would  change  the  number of channels to 6 and set up 4
                      routes that copy channel 0 to channels 0 to 3.   Channel
                      4 and 5 will contain silence.

       format[=format] (also see -format)
              Convert between different sample formats.  Automatically enabled
              when needed by the sound card or another filter.
                 <format>
                      Sets the desired format.  The  general  form  is  ’sbe’,
                      where ’s’ denotes the sign (either ’s’ for signed or ’u’
                      for unsigned), ’b’ denotes the number of bits per sample
                      (16,  24  or  32)  and  ’e’ denotes the endianness (’le’
                      means little-endian, ’be’ big-endian and ’ne’ the  endi‐
                      anness  of  the  computer MPlayer is running on).  Valid
                      values  (amongst  others)  are:  ’s16le’,  ’u32be’   and
                      ’u24ne’.   Exceptions  to  this rule that are also valid
                      format specifiers: u8, s8,  floatle,  floatbe,  floatne,
                      mulaw, alaw, mpeg2, ac3 and imaadpcm.

       volume[=v[:sc]]
              Implements  software  volume control.  Use this filter with cau‐
              tion since it can reduce the signal to noise ratio of the sound.
              In  most  cases it is best to set the level for the PCM sound to
              max, leave this filter out and control the output level to  your
              speakers  with  the master volume control of the mixer.  In case
              your sound card has a digital PCM mixer  instead  of  an  analog
              one,  and you hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead.  If
              there is an external amplifier connected to the  computer  (this
              is  almost always the case), the noise level can be minimized by
              adjusting the master level and the volume knob on the  amplifier
              until the hissing noise in the background is gone.
              This  filter has a second feature: It measures the overall maxi‐
              mum sound level and prints out that level  when  MPlayer  exits.
              This  volume estimate can be used for setting the sound level in
              MEncoder such that the maximum dynamic range is utilized.
              NOTE: This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be en‐
              abled once for every audio stream.
                 <v>
                      Sets  the  desired  gain  in  dB for all channels in the
                      stream from -200dB to  +60dB,  where  -200dB  mutes  the
                      sound  completely  and  +60dB equals a gain of 1000 (de‐
                      fault: 0).
                 <sc>
                      Turns soft clipping on (1) or  off  (0).   Soft-clipping
                      can  make the sound more smooth if very high volume lev‐
                      els are used.  Enable this option if the  dynamic  range
                      of the loudspeakers is very low.
                      WARNING:  This  feature creates distortion and should be
                      considered a last resort.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af volume=10.1:0 media.avi
                      Would amplify the sound by 10.1dB and hard-clip  if  the
                      sound level is too high.

       pan=n[:L00:L01:L02:...L10:L11:L12:...Ln0:Ln1:Ln2:...]
              Mixes channels arbitrarily.  Basically a combination of the vol‐
              ume and the channels filter that can be used  to  down-mix  many
              channels  to only a few, e.g. stereo to mono or vary the "width"
              of the center speaker in a surround sound system.   This  filter
              is  hard  to use, and will require some tinkering before the de‐
              sired result is obtained.  The number of options for this filter
              depends  on  the  number  of output channels.  An example how to
              downmix a six-channel file to two channels with this filter  can
              be found in the examples section near the end.
                 <n>
                      number of output channels (1-6)
                 <Lij>
                      How much of input channel i is mixed into output channel
                      j (0-1).  So in principle you first have n numbers  say‐
                      ing what to do with the first input channel, then n num‐
                      bers that act on the second input channel etc.   If  you
                      do not specify any numbers for some input channels, 0 is
                      assumed.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af pan=1:0.5:0.5 media.avi
                      Would down-mix from stereo to mono.
                 mplayer -af pan=3:1:0:0.5:0:1:0.5 media.avi
                      Would give 3 channel output leaving channels 0 and 1 in‐
                      tact,  and  mix  channels  0 and 1 into output channel 2
                      (which could be sent to a subwoofer for example).

       sub[=fc:ch]
              Adds a subwoofer channel to the audio stream.   The  audio  data
              used  for  creating  the  subwoofer channel is an average of the
              sound in channel 0 and channel 1.  The resulting sound  is  then
              low-pass  filtered  by a 4th order Butterworth filter with a de‐
              fault cutoff frequency of 60Hz and added to a  separate  channel
              in the audio stream.
              Warning: Disable this filter when you are playing DVDs with Dol‐
              by Digital 5.1 sound, otherwise this  filter  will  disrupt  the
              sound to the subwoofer.
                 <fc>
                      cutoff  frequency in Hz for the low-pass filter (20Hz to
                      300Hz) (default: 60Hz) For the best result  try  setting
                      the  cutoff frequency as low as possible.  This will im‐
                      prove the stereo or surround sound experience.
                 <ch>
                      Determines the channel number in  which  to  insert  the
                      sub-channel  audio.  Channel number can be between 0 and
                      5 (default: 5).  Observe that  the  number  of  channels
                      will automatically be increased to <ch> if necessary.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af sub=100:4 -channels 5 media.avi
                      Would  add  a sub-woofer channel with a cutoff frequency
                      of 100Hz to output channel 4.

       center
              Creates a center channel from the front channels.  May currently
              be  low  quality as it does not implement a high-pass filter for
              proper extraction yet, but averages and halves the channels  in‐
              stead.
                 <ch>
                      Determines  the  channel  number  in which to insert the
                      center channel.  Channel number can be between 0  and  5
                      (default:  5).  Observe that the number of channels will
                      automatically be increased to <ch> if necessary.

       surround[=delay]
              Decoder for matrix encoded surround sound like  Dolby  Surround.
              Many  files  with 2 channel audio actually contain matrixed sur‐
              round sound.  Requires a sound card supporting at least 4  chan‐
              nels.
                 <delay>
                      delay  time in ms for the rear speakers (0 to 1000) (de‐
                      fault: 20) This delay should be set as follows: If d1 is
                      the  distance  from  the listening position to the front
                      speakers and d2 is the distance from the listening posi‐
                      tion  to the rear speakers, then the delay should be set
                      to 15ms if d1 <= d2 and to 15 + 5*(d1-d2) if d1 > d2.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af surround=15 -channels 4 media.avi
                      Would add surround sound decoding with  15ms  delay  for
                      the sound to the rear speakers.

       delay[=ch1:ch2:...]
              Delays  the  sound  to the loudspeakers such that the sound from
              the different channels arrives at the listening position  simul‐
              taneously.  It is only useful if you have more than 2 loudspeak‐
              ers.
                 ch1,ch2,...
                      The delay in ms that should be imposed on  each  channel
                      (floating point number between 0 and 1000).

              To calculate the required delay for the different channels do as
              follows:

              1. Measure the distance to the loudspeakers in meters  in  rela‐
                 tion  to your listening position, giving you the distances s1
                 to s5 (for a 5.1 system).  There is no point in  compensating
                 for  the subwoofer (you will not hear the difference anyway).

              2. Subtract the distances s1 to s5 from  the  maximum  distance,
                 i.e. s[i] = max(s) - s[i]; i = 1...5.

              3. Calculate  the required delays in ms as d[i] = 1000*s[i]/342;
                 i = 1...5.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af delay=10.5:10.5:0:0:7:0 media.avi
                      Would delay front left and right by 10.5ms, the two rear
                      channels  and  the  sub by 0ms and the center channel by
                      7ms.

       export[=mmapped_file[:nsamples]]
              Exports the incoming signal to other processes using memory map‐
              ping (mmap()).  Memory mapped areas contain a header:

              int nch                      /*number of channels*/
              int size                     /*buffer size*/
              unsigned long long counter   /*Used to keep sync, updated every
                                             time new data is exported.*/

              The rest is payload (non-interleaved) 16 bit data.
                 <mmapped_file>
                      file  to map data to (default: ~/.mplayer/mplayer-af_ex‐
                      port)
                 <nsamples>
                      number of samples per channel (default: 512)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af export=/tmp/mplayer-af_export:1024 media.avi
                      Would export 1024 samples per channel to  ’/tmp/mplayer-
                      af_export’.

       extrastereo[=mul]
              (Linearly) increases the difference between left and right chan‐
              nels which adds some sort of "live" effect to playback.
                 <mul>
                      Sets the difference  coefficient  (default:  2.5).   0.0
                      means  mono  sound  (average of both channels), with 1.0
                      sound will be unchanged, with -1.0 left and right  chan‐
                      nels will be swapped.

       volnorm[=method:target]
              Maximizes the volume without distorting the sound.
                 <method>
                      Sets the used method.
                         1:  Use  a single sample to smooth the variations via
                         the standard weighted mean  over  past  samples  (de‐
                         fault).
                         2:  Use  several samples to smooth the variations via
                         the standard weighted mean over past samples.

                 <target>
                      Sets the target amplitude as a fraction of  the  maximum
                      for the sample type (default: 0.25).

       ladspa=file:label[:controls...]
              Load  a LADSPA (Linux Audio Developer’s Simple Plugin API) plug‐
              in.  This filter is reentrant, so multiple LADSPA plugins can be
              used at once.
                 <file>
                      Specifies   the   LADSPA   plugin   library   file.   If
                      LADSPA_PATH is set, it searches for the specified  file.
                      If  it  is  not  set,  you must supply a fully specified
                      pathname.
                 <label>
                      Specifies the filter within the library.  Some libraries
                      contain  only  one  filter,  but  others contain many of
                      them.  Entering ’help’ here,  will  list  all  available
                      filters  within  the specified library, which eliminates
                      the use of ’listplugins’ from the LADSPA SDK.
                 <controls>
                      Controls are zero or more floating point values that de‐
                      termine  the  behavior of the loaded plugin (for example
                      delay, threshold or gain).  In verbose mode (add  -v  to
                      the  MPlayer  command  line), all available controls and
                      their valid ranges are printed.  This eliminates the use
                      of ’analyseplugin’ from the LADSPA SDK.

       comp
              Compressor/expander  filter  usable  for microphone input.  Pre‐
              vents artifacts on very loud sound and raises the volume on very
              low sound.  This filter is untested, maybe even unusable.

       gate
              Noise gate filter similar to the comp audio filter.  This filter
              is untested, maybe even unusable.

       karaoke
              Simple voice removal filter exploiting the fact  that  voice  is
              usually  recorded  with  mono gear and later ’center’ mixed onto
              the final audio stream.  Beware that this filter will turn  your
              signal into mono.  Works well for 2 channel tracks; do not both‐
              er trying it on anything but 2 channel stereo.

VIDEO FILTERS
       Video filters allow you to modify the video stream and its  properties.
       The syntax is:

       -vf <filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...>
              Setup a chain of video filters.

       Many  parameters are optional and set to default values if omitted.  To
       explicitly use a default value set a parameter to ’-1’.  Parameters w:h
       means width x height in pixels, x:y means x;y position counted from the
       upper left corner of the bigger image.
       NOTE: To get a full list of available video filters, see -vf help.

       Video filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage
       the filter list.

       -vf-add <filter1[,filter2,...]>
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -vf-pre <filter1[,filter2,...]>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -vf-del <index1[,index2,...]>
              Deletes  the  filters at the given indexes.  Index numbers start
              at 0, negative numbers address the end of the list  (-1  is  the
              last).

       -vf-clr
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With  filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

       -vf <filter>=help
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a par‐
              ticular filter.

       -vf <filter=named_parameter1=value1[:named_parameter2=value2:...]>
              Sets  a  named  parameter to the given value.  Use on and off or
              yes and no to set flag parameters.

       Available filters are:

       crop[=w:h:x:y]
              Crops the given part of the image and discards the rest.  Useful
              to remove black bands from widescreen movies.
                 <w>,<h>
                      Cropped width and height, defaults to original width and
                      height.
                 <x>,<y>
                      Position of the cropped picture, defaults to center.

       cropdetect[=limit:round]
              Calculates necessary cropping parameters and prints  the  recom‐
              mended parameters to stdout.
                 <limit>
                      Threshold,  which can be optionally specified from noth‐
                      ing (0) to everything (255) (default: 24).
                 <round>
                      Value which the width/height should be divisible by (de‐
                      fault:  16).   The  offset  is automatically adjusted to
                      center the video.  Use 2 to  get  only  even  dimensions
                      (needed  for  4:2:2 video).  16 is best when encoding to
                      most video codecs.

       rectangle[=w:h:x:y]
              The plugin responds to the input.conf directive  ’change_rectan‐
              gle’ that takes two parameters.
                 <w>,<h>
                      width  and  height  (default: -1, maximum possible width
                      where boundaries are still visible.)
                 <x>,<y>
                      top left corner position (default: -1,  uppermost  left‐
                      most)

       expand[=w:h:x:y:o:a:r]
              Expands  (not  scales)  movie  resolution to the given value and
              places the unscaled original at coordinates x, y.  Can  be  used
              for placing subtitles/OSD in the resulting black bands.

                 <w>,<h>
                      Expanded  width,height (default: original width,height).
                      Negative values for w and h are treated  as  offsets  to
                      the original size.

                      EXAMPLE:
                           expand=0:-50:0:0
                                  Adds  a 50 pixel border to the bottom of the
                                  picture.

                 <x>,<y>
                      position of original image on the  expanded  image  (de‐
                      fault: center)

                 <o>
                      OSD/subtitle rendering
                         0: disable (default)
                         1: enable

                 <a>
                      Expands  to  fit  an aspect instead of a resolution (de‐
                      fault: 0).

                      EXAMPLE:
                           expand=800:::::4/3
                                  Expands to 800x600,  unless  the  source  is
                                  higher  resolution, in which case it expands
                                  to fill a 4/3 aspect.

                 <r>
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by <r>
                      (default: 1).

       flip (also see -flip)
              Flips the image upside down.

       mirror
              Mirrors the image on the Y axis.

       rotate[=<0-7>]
              Rotates  the  image  by 90 degrees and optionally flips it.  For
              values between 4-7 rotation is only done if the  movie  geometry
              is portrait and not landscape.

                 0    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip (default).

                 1    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

                 2    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

                 3    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and flip.

       scale[=w:h[:ilaced[:chr_drop[:par[:par2[:presize[:noup[:arnd]]]]]]]]
              Scales  the image with the software scaler (slow) and performs a
              YUV<->RGB colorspace conversion (also see -sws).

                 <w>,<h>
                      scaled width/height (default: original width/height)
                      NOTE: If -zoom is used, and underlying filters  (includ‐
                      ing  libvo)  are  incapable  of  scaling, it defaults to
                      d_width/d_height!
                          0:   scaled d_width/d_height
                         -1:   original width/height
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         prescaled aspect ratio.
                         -3:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original aspect ratio.
                         -(n+8): Like -n above, but rounding the dimension  to
                         the closest multiple of 16.

                 <chr_drop>
                      chroma skipping
                         0: Use all available input lines for chroma.
                         1: Use only every 2. input line for chroma.
                         2: Use only every 4. input line for chroma.
                         3: Use only every 8. input line for chroma.

                 <par>[:<par2>] (also see -sws)
                      Set  some  scaling  parameters  depending on the type of
                      scaler selected with -sws.
                         -sws 2 (bicubic):  B (blurring) and C (ringing)
                         0.00:0.60 default

                 <noup>
                      Disallow upscaling past the original dimensions.
                         0: Allow upscaling (default).
                         1:  Disallow  upscaling  if one dimension exceeds its
                         original value.
                         2: Disallow upscaling if both dimensions exceed their
                         original values.

                 <arnd>

                      faster or slower than the default rounding.
                         0: Disable accurate rounding (default).
                         1: Enable accurate rounding.

       dsize[=aspect|w:h:aspect-method:r]
              Changes the intended display size/aspect at an  arbitrary  point
              in the filter chain.  Aspect can be given as a fraction (4/3) or
              floating point number (1.33).  Alternatively,  you  may  specify
              the exact display width and height desired.  Note that this fil‐
              ter does not do any scaling itself; it just affects  what  later
              scalers (software or hardware) will do when auto-scaling to cor‐
              rect aspect.

                 <w>,<h>
                      New display width and height.  Can also be these special
                      values:
                          0:   original display width and height
                         -1:   original video width and height (default)
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original display aspect ratio.
                         -3:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original video aspect ratio.

                 EXAMPLE:
                           dsize=800:-2
                                  Specifies  a  display  resolution of 800x600
                                  for a 4/3 aspect video,  or  800x450  for  a
                                  16/9 aspect video.
                 <aspect-method>
                      Modifies  width  and height according to original aspect
                      ratios.
                         -1: Ignore original aspect ratio (default).
                          0: Keep display aspect ratio by using <w> and <h> as
                         maximum resolution.
                          1: Keep display aspect ratio by using <w> and <h> as
                         minimum resolution.
                          2: Keep video aspect ratio by using <w> and  <h>  as
                         maximum resolution.
                          3:  Keep  video aspect ratio by using <w> and <h> as
                         minimum resolution.

                 EXAMPLE:
                           dsize=800:600:0
                                  Specifies a display resolution  of  at  most
                                  800x600,  or  smaller,  in order to keep as‐
                                  pect.

                 <r>
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by <r>
                      (default: 1).

       yuy2
              Forces  software  YV12/I420/422P to YUY2 conversion.  Useful for
              video cards/drivers with slow YV12 but fast YUY2 support.

       yvu9
              Forces software YVU9 to YV12 colorspace conversion.   Deprecated
              in favor of the software scaler.

       yuvcsp
              Clamps YUV color values to the CCIR 601 range without doing real
              conversion.

       rgb2bgr[=swap]
              RGB 24/32 <-> BGR 24/32 colorspace conversion.
                 swap
                      Also perform  R <-> B swapping.

       palette
              RGB/BGR 8 -> 15/16/24/32bpp colorspace conversion using palette.

       format[=fourcc]
              Restricts  the  colorspace for the next filter without doing any
              conversion.  Use together with the scale filter for a real  con‐
              version.
              NOTE: For a list of available formats see format=fmt=help.
                 <fourcc>
                      format name like rgb15, bgr24, yv12, etc (default: yuy2)

       noformat[=fourcc]
              Restricts the colorspace for the next filter without  doing  any
              conversion.   Unlike the format filter, this will allow any col‐
              orspace except the one you specify.
              NOTE: For a list of available formats see noformat=fmt=help.
                 <fourcc>
                      format name like rgb15, bgr24, yv12, etc (default: yv12)

       pp[=filter1[:option1[:option2...]]/[-]filter2...] (also see -pphelp)
              Enables  the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters.  Sub‐
              filters must be separated by ’/’ and can be disabled by prepend‐
              ing  a  ’-’.  Each subfilter and some options have a short and a
              long name that can be used interchangeably, i.e.  dr/dering  are
              the  same.   All  subfilters  share  common options to determine
              their scope:
                 a/autoq
                      Automatically switch the subfilter off if the CPU is too
                      slow.
                 c/chrom
                      Do chrominance filtering, too (default).
                 y/nochrom
                      Do luminance filtering only (no chrominance).
                 n/noluma
                      Do chrominance filtering only (no luminance).

              NOTE: -pphelp shows a list of available subfilters.

              Available subfilters are

                 hb/hdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]

                         <difference>:  Difference  factor where higher values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 va/vadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      accurate vertical deblocking filter
                         <difference>:  Difference  factor where higher values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share the dif‐
                 ference and flatness values so you cannot set different hori‐
                 zontal and vertical thresholds.

       spp[=quality[:qp[:mode]]]
              Simple postprocessing filter that  compresses  and  decompresses
              the image at several (or - in the case of quality level 6 - all)
              shifts and averages the results.

                 <quality>
                      0-6 (default: 3)

                 <qp>
                      Force quantization parameter (default: 0,  use  QP  from
                      video).

                 <mode>
                      0: hard thresholding (default)
                      1: soft thresholding (better deringing, but blurrier)
                      4: like 0, but also use B-frames’ QP (may cause flicker)
                      5: like 1, but also use B-frames’ QP (may cause flicker)

       uspp[=quality[:qp]]
              Ultra  simple  &  slow postprocessing filter that compresses and
              decompresses the image at several (or - in the case  of  quality
              level  8  -  all) shifts and averages the results.  The way this
              differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
              decodes  each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a sim‐
              plified intra only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.

                 <quality>
                      0-8 (default: 3)

                 <qp>

                 <qp>
                      Force  quantization  parameter  (default: 0, use QP from
                      video).

                 <-15-32>
                      Filter strength, lower values mean more details but also
                      more  artifacts,  while  higher  values  make  the image
                      smoother but also blurrier (default: 0 - PSNR  optimal).

                 <bframes>
                      0: do not use QP from B-frames (default)
                      1: use QP from B-frames too (may cause flicker)

       pp7[=qp[:mode]]
              Variant  of  the  spp  filter, similar to spp=6 with 7 point DCT
              where only the center sample is used after IDCT.

                 <qp>
                      Force quantization parameter (default: 0,  use  QP  from
                      video).

                 <mode>
                      0: hard thresholding
                      1: soft thresholding (better deringing, but blurrier)
                      2: medium thresholding (default, good results)

       geq=equation
              generic equation change filter

                 <equation>

                      zontally.  You can use whitespace to make  the  equation
                      more readable.  There are a couple of constants that can
                      be used in the equation:
                         PI: the number pi
                         E: the number e
                         X / Y: the coordinates of the current sample
                         W / H: width and height of the image
                         SW / SH: width/height scale depending on the current‐
                         ly  filtered  plane,  e.g.  1,1  and  0.5,0.5 for YUV
                         4:2:0.
                         p(x,y): returns the value of the  pixel  at  location
                         x/y of the current plane.

              sues.  You should see a red, green and blue stripe from  top  to
              bottom.

       lavc[=quality:fps]
              Fast  software YV12 to MPEG-1 conversion with libavcodec for use
              with DVB/DXR3/IVTV.

                 <quality>

                 <fps>
                      force output fps (float value) (default:  0,  autodetect
                      based on height)

       dvbscale[=aspect]
              Set  up  optimal  scaling  for  DVB cards, scaling the x axis in
              hardware and calculating the y axis scaling in software to  keep
              aspect.  Only useful together with expand and scale.

                 <aspect>
                      Control  aspect ratio, calculate as DVB_HEIGHT*ASPECTRA‐
                      TIO (default: 576*4/3=768), set  it  to  576*(16/9)=1024
                      for a 16:9 TV.

                 u    uniform noise (gaussian otherwise)
                 t    temporal noise (noise pattern changes between frames)
                 a    averaged temporal noise (smoother, but a lot slower)
                 h    high quality (slightly better looking, slightly slower)
                 p    mix random noise with a (semi)regular pattern

       denoise3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]
              This  filter  aims to reduce image noise producing smooth images
              and making still images really still (This should  enhance  com‐
              pressibility.).
                 <luma_spatial>
                      spatial luma strength (default: 4)
                 <chroma_spatial>
                      spatial chroma strength (default: 3)
                 <luma_tmp>
                      luma temporal strength (default: 6)
                 <chroma_tmp>
                      chroma  temporal strength (default: luma_tmp*chroma_spa‐
                      tial/luma_spatial)

       hqdn3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]
              High precision/quality version of the denoise3d filter.  Parame‐
              ters and usage are the same.

       eq[=brightness:contrast] (OBSOLETE)
              Software equalizer with interactive controls just like the hard‐
              ware equalizer, for cards/drivers that do not support brightness
              and  contrast  controls  in hardware.  Might also be useful with
              MEncoder, either for  fixing  poorly  captured  movies,  or  for
              slightly  reducing  contrast  to  mask artifacts and get by with
              lower bitrates.
                 <-100-100>

                 <-100-100>
                      initial contrast

       eq2[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]
              Alternative software equalizer that  uses  lookup  tables  (very
              slow),  allowing  gamma correction in addition to simple bright‐
              ness and contrast adjustment.  Note that it uses  the  same  MMX
              optimized  code  as -vf eq if all gamma values are 1.0.  The pa‐
              rameters are given as floating point values.
                 <0.1-10>
                      initial gamma value (default: 1.0)
                 <-2-2>
                      initial contrast, where negative values result in a neg‐
                      ative image (default: 1.0)
                 <-1-1>
                      initial brightness (default: 0.0)
                 <0-3>
                      initial saturation (default: 1.0)
                 <0.1-10>
                      gamma value for the red component (default: 1.0)
                 <0.1-10>
                      gamma value for the green component (default: 1.0)
                 <0.1-10>
                      gamma value for the blue component (default: 1.0)
                 <0-1>
                      The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of
                      a high gamma value on bright image areas, e.g. keep them
                      from getting overamplified and just plain white.  A val‐
                      ue of 0.0 turns the gamma correction all  the  way  down
                      while 1.0 leaves it at its full strength (default: 1.0).

       hue[=hue:saturation]
              Software equalizer with interactive controls just like the hard‐
              ware  equalizer,  for  cards/drivers that do not support hue and
              saturation controls in hardware.
                 <-180-180>
                      initial hue (default: 0.0)
                 <-100-100>
                      initial saturation, where negative values  result  in  a
                      negative chroma (default: 1.0)

       halfpack[=f]
              Convert  planar  YUV 4:2:0 to half-height packed 4:2:2, downsam‐
              pling luma but keeping all chroma samples.  Useful for output to
              low-resolution display devices when hardware downscaling is poor
              quality or is not available.  Can also be used  as  a  primitive
              luma-only deinterlacer with very low CPU usage.
                 <f>
                      By  default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when down‐
                      sampling.  Any value different from 0 or 1 gives the de‐
                      fault (averaging) behavior.
                         0: Only use even lines when downsampling.
                         1: Only use odd lines when downsampling.

       ilpack[=mode]
              When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma in‐
              terlacing does not line up properly due to vertical downsampling
              of the chroma channels.  This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data
              into YUY2 (4:2:2) format with the chroma lines in  their  proper
              locations,  so  that  in any given scanline, the luma and chroma
              data both come from the same field.
                 <mode>
                      Select the sampling mode.
                         0: nearest-neighbor sampling, fast but incorrect
                         1: linear interpolation (default)

       harddup
              Only useful with MEncoder.  If harddup is used when encoding, it
              will  force  duplicate frames to be encoded in the output.  This
              uses slightly more space, but is necessary for  output  to  MPEG
              files  or  if you plan to demux and remux the video stream after
              encoding.  Should be placed at or near the  end  of  the  filter
              chain unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.

              Only  useful  with  MEncoder.  Softskip moves the frame skipping
              (dropping) step of encoding from before the filter chain to some
              point  during  the filter chain.  This allows filters which need
              to see all frames (inverse telecine, temporal  denoising,  etc.)
              to  function properly.  Should be placed after the filters which
              need to see all frames and before any  subsequent  filters  that
              are CPU-intensive.

       decimate[=max:hi:lo:frac]
              Drops  frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame
              in order to reduce framerate.  The main use of  this  filter  is
              for  very-low-bitrate  encoding  (e.g. streaming over dialup mo‐
              dem), but it could in theory be used for fixing movies that were
              inverse-telecined incorrectly.
                 <max>
                      Sets  the maximum number of consecutive frames which can
                      be dropped (if positive), or the  minimum  interval  be‐
                      tween dropped frames (if negative).
                 <hi>,<lo>,<frac>
                      A  frame  is  a  candidate for dropping if no 8x8 region
                      differs by more than a threshold of  <hi>,  and  if  not
                      more  than  <frac>  portion  (1 meaning the whole image)
                      differs by more than a threshold  of  <lo>.   Values  of
                      <hi> and <lo> are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent ac‐
                      tual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64  cor‐
                      responds  to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the
                      same spread out differently over the block.

       dint[=sense:level]
              The drop-deinterlace (dint) filter detects and drops  the  first
              from a set of interlaced video frames.
                 <0.0-1.0>
                      relative difference between neighboring pixels (default:
                      0.1)
                 <0.0-1.0>
                      What part of the image has to be detected as  interlaced
                      to drop the frame (default: 0.15).

       lavcdeint (OBSOLETE)
              FFmpeg deinterlacing filter, same as -vf pp=fd

       kerndeint[=thresh[:map[:order[:sharp[:twoway]]]]]
              Donald Graft’s adaptive kernel deinterlacer.  Deinterlaces parts
              of a video if a configurable threshold is exceeded.
                 <0-255>
                      threshold (default: 10)
                 <map>
                         0: Ignore pixels exceeding the threshold (default).
                         1: Paint pixels exceeding the threshold white.

                 <order>
                         0: Leave fields alone (default).
                         1: Swap fields.

                 <sharp>
                         0: Disable additional sharpening (default).
                         1: Enable additional sharpening.

                 <twoway>
                         0: Disable twoway sharpening (default).
                         1: Enable twoway sharpening.

       unsharp[=l|cWxH:amount[:l|cWxH:amount]]
              unsharp mask / gaussian blur

                 l
                      Apply effect on luma component.

                 c
                      Apply effect on chroma components.

                 <width>x<height>
                      width and height of the matrix, odd sized in both direc‐
                      tions  (min  =  3x3, max = 13x11 or 11x13, usually some‐
                      thing between 3x3 and 7x7)

                 amount
                      Relative amount of sharpness/blur to add to the image (a
                      sane range should be -1.5-1.5).
                         <0: blur
                         >0: sharpen

       swapuv
              Swap U & V plane.

       il[=d|i][s][:[d|i][s]]
              (De)interleaves  lines.   The  goal of this filter is to add the
              ability to process interlaced images pre-field without  deinter‐
              lacing  them.  You can filter your interlaced DVD and play it on
              a TV without  breaking  the  interlacing.   While  deinterlacing
              (with the postprocessing filter) removes interlacing permanently
              (by smoothing, averaging, etc) deinterleaving splits  the  frame
              into  2  fields  (so  called  half pictures), so you can process
              (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.
                 d    deinterleave (placing one above the other)
                 i    interleave
                 s    swap fields (exchange even & odd lines)

       fil[=i|d]
              (De)interleaves lines.  This filter is very similar  to  the  il
              filter  but  much  faster, the main disadvantage is that it does
              not always work.  Especially if combined with other  filters  it
              may  produce  randomly messed up images, so be happy if it works
              but do not complain if it does not for your combination of  fil‐
              ters.
                 d    Deinterleave fields, placing them side by side.
                 i    Interleave fields again (reversing the effect of fil=d).

       field[=n]
              Extracts a single field from an interlaced  image  using  stride
              arithmetic  to  avoid wasting CPU time.  The optional argument n
              specifies whether to extract the even or the odd field  (depend‐
              ing on whether n is even or odd).

       detc[=var1=value1:var2=value2:...]
              Attempts  to  reverse the ’telecine’ process to recover a clean,
              non-interlaced stream at film framerate.  This was the first and
              most  primitive  inverse telecine filter to be added to MPlayer/
              MEncoder.  It works by latching onto the  telecine  3:2  pattern
              and  following  it  as long as possible.  This makes it suitable
              for perfectly-telecined material, even in the presence of a fair
              degree  of  noise,  but  it will fail in the presence of complex
              post-telecine edits.  Development on this filter  is  no  longer
              taking  place, as ivtc, pullup, and filmdint are better for most
              applications.  The following arguments (see syntax above) may be
              used to control detc’s behavior:

                 <dr>
                      Set the frame dropping mode.
                         0:  Do not drop frames to maintain fixed output fram‐
                         erate (default).
                         1: Always drop a frame when there have been no  drops
                         or telecine merges in the past 5 frames.
                         2:  Always  maintain  exact 5:4 input to output frame
                         ratio.
                         NOTE: Use mode 1 or 2 with MEncoder.

                 <am>
                      Analysis mode.
                         0: Fixed pattern with initial frame number  specified
                         by <fr>.
                         1: aggressive search for telecine pattern (default)

                 <fr>
                      Set initial frame number in sequence.  0-2 are the three
                      clean progressive frames; 3 and 4 are the two interlaced
                      frames.   The  default,  -1,  means ’not in telecine se‐
                      quence’.  The number specified here is the type for  the
                      imaginary previous frame before the movie starts.

                 <t0>, <t1>, <t2>, <t3>
                      Threshold values to be used in certain modes.

       ivtc[=1]
              Experimental  ’stateless’  inverse telecine filter.  Rather than
              trying to lock on to a pattern like the detc filter  does,  ivtc
              makes  its  decisions  independently  for each frame.  This will
              give much better results for material that has  undergone  heavy
              editing after telecine was applied, but as a result it is not as
              forgiving of noisy input, for example TV capture.  The  optional
              parameter  (ivtc=1)  corresponds to the dr=1 option for the detc
              filter, and should be used with MEncoder but not  with  MPlayer.
              As  with  detc,  you  must  specify the correct output framerate
              (-ofps 24000/1001) when using MEncoder.  Further development  on
              ivtc  has  stopped, as the pullup and filmdint filters appear to
              be much more accurate.

       pullup[=jl:jr:jt:jb:sb:mp]
              Third-generation pulldown reversal  (inverse  telecine)  filter,
              capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progres‐
              sive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.  The pullup filter
              is  designed to be much more robust than detc or ivtc, by taking
              advantage of future context in making its decisions.  Like ivtc,
              pullup  is  stateless  in the sense that it does not lock onto a
              pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
              fields  in  order  to  identify  matches and rebuild progressive
              frames.  It is still under development, but believed to be quite
              accurate.

                 jl, jr, jt, and jb
                      These  options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the
                      left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively.
                      Left/right  are  in  units of 8 pixels, while top/bottom
                      are in units of 2 lines.  The default  is  8  pixels  on
                      each side.

                 sb (strict breaks)
                      Setting  this  option  to  1  will reduce the chances of
                      pullup generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it
                      may  also  cause  an  excessive  number  of frames to be
                      dropped during high motion sequences.  Conversely,  set‐
                      ting it to -1 will make pullup match fields more easily.
                      This may help processing of video where there is  slight
                      blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to
                      be interlaced frames in the output.

                 mp (metric plane)
                      This option may be set to 1 or 2 to use a  chroma  plane
                      instead  of  the  luma plane for doing pullup’s computa‐
                      tions.  This may improve accuracy on very  clean  source
                      material,  but more likely will decrease accuracy, espe‐
                      cially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or  any
                      grayscale  video.   The  main purpose of setting mp to a
                      chroma plane is to reduce CPU load and make  pullup  us‐
                      able in realtime on slow machines.

              NOTE:  Always follow pullup with the softskip filter when encod‐
              ing to ensure that pullup is able to see each frame.  Failure to
              do  so will lead to incorrect output and will usually crash, due
              to design limitations in the codec/filter layer.

       filmdint[=options]
              Inverse telecine filter, similar to the pullup filter above.  It
              is designed to handle any pulldown pattern, including mixed soft
              and hard telecine and limited support for movies that are slowed
              down  or sped up from their original framerate for TV.  Only the
              luma plane is used to find the frame breaks.  If a field has  no
              match,  it is deinterlaced with simple linear approximation.  If
              the source is MPEG-2, this must be the first filter to allow ac‐
              cess to the field-flags set by the MPEG-2 decoder.  Depending on
              the source MPEG, you may be fine ignoring this advice,  as  long
              as  you  do not see lots of "Bottom-first field" warnings.  With
              no options it does normal inverse telecine, and should  be  used
              together  with  mencoder -fps 30000/1001 -ofps 24000/1001.  When
              this filter is used with mplayer, it will result  in  an  uneven
              framerate during playback, but it is still generally better than
              using pp=lb or no deinterlacing at all.  Multiple options can be
              specified separated by /.

                 crop=<w>:<h>:<x>:<y>
                      Just  like  the  crop  filter,  but faster, and works on
                      mixed hard and soft telecined content as well as when  y
                      is  not  a multiple of 4.  If x or y would require crop‐
                      ping fractional pixels from the chroma planes, the  crop
                      area  is extended.  This usually means that x and y must
                      be even.

                 io=<ifps>:<ofps>
                      For each ifps input frames the filter will  output  ofps
                      frames.    The  ratio  of  ifps/ofps  should  match  the
                      -fps/-ofps ratio.  This could be used to  filter  movies
                      that  are broadcast on TV at a frame rate different from
                      their original framerate.

                 luma_only=<n>
                      If n is nonzero, the chroma plane is  copied  unchanged.
                      This  is  useful for YV12 sampled TV, which discards one
                      of the chroma fields.

                 mmx2=<n>
                      On x86, if n=1, use MMX2 optimized  functions,  if  n=2,
                      use 3DNow!  optimized functions, otherwise, use plain C.
                      If this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are au‐
                      to-detected, use this option to override auto-detection.

                 fast=<n>
                      The larger n will speed up the filter at the expense  of
                      accuracy.   The  default  value  is n=3.  If n is odd, a
                      frame immediately following a frame marked with the  RE‐
                      PEAT_FIRST_FIELD MPEG flag is assumed to be progressive,
                      thus filter will not spend any  time  on  soft-telecined
                      MPEG-2 content.  This is the only effect of this flag if
                      MMX2 or 3DNow! is available.  Without MMX2 and 3DNow, if
                      n=0 or 1, the same calculations will be used as with n=2
                      or 3.  If n=2 or 3, the number of luma  levels  used  to
                      find  the frame breaks is reduced from 256 to 128, which
                      results in a faster filter without losing much accuracy.
                      If  n=4  or  5,  a faster, but much less accurate metric
                      will be used to find the frame  breaks,  which  is  more
                      likely  to  misdetect high vertical detail as interlaced
                      content.

                 verbose=<n>
                      If n is nonzero, print the  detailed  metrics  for  each
                      frame.  Useful for debugging.

                 dint_thres=<n>
                      Deinterlace  threshold.   Used  during de-interlacing of
                      unmatched frames.  Larger value means  less  deinterlac‐
                      ing,  use  n=256  to  completely turn off deinterlacing.
                      Default is n=8.

                 comb_thres=<n>
                      Threshold for comparing a top and  bottom  fields.   De‐
                      faults to 128.

                 diff_thres=<n>
                      Threshold to detect temporal change of a field.  Default
                      is 128.

                 sad_thres=<n>
                      Sum of Absolute Difference threshold, default is 64.

       softpulldown
              This filter works only correct with MEncoder  and  acts  on  the
              MPEG-2 flags used for soft 3:2 pulldown (soft telecine).  If you
              want to use the ivtc or detc filter on movies  that  are  partly
              soft  telecined,  inserting  this filter before them should make
              them more reliable.

       divtc[=options]
              Inverse  telecine  for  deinterlaced  video.   If   3:2-pulldown
              telecined  video  has  lost one of the fields or is deinterlaced
              using a method that keeps one field and interpolates the  other,
              the  result is a juddering video that has every fourth frame du‐
              plicated.  This filter is intended to find and drop those dupli‐
              cates  and restore the original film framerate.  When using this
              filter, you must specify -ofps that is 4/5 of the fps of the in‐
              put  file  and  place  the softskip later in the filter chain to
              make sure that divtc sees all the frames.  Two  different  modes
              are  available: One pass mode is the default and is straightfor‐
              ward to use, but has the disadvantage that any  changes  in  the
              telecine phase (lost frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder
              until the filter can resync again.  Two pass mode avoids this by
              analyzing  the  whole  video  beforehand so it will have forward
              knowledge about the phase changes and can resync  at  the  exact
              spot.  These passes do not correspond to pass one and two of the
              encoding process.  You must run an extra pass using  divtc  pass
              one  before  the  actual  encoding  throwing the resulting video
              away.  Use -nosound -ovc raw -o /dev/null to avoid  wasting  CPU
              power  for  this  pass.  You may add something like crop=2:2:0:0
              after divtc to speed things up even more.  Then use  divtc  pass
              two  for the actual encoding.  If you use multiple encoder pass‐
              es, use divtc pass two for all of them.  The options are:

                 pass=1|2
                      Use two pass mode.

                 file=<filename>
                      Set  the  two  pass  log  filename  (default:   "framed‐
                      iff.log").

                 threshold=<value>
                      Set  the minimum strength the telecine pattern must have
                      for the filter to believe in it (default: 0.5).  This is
                      used  to  avoid recognizing false pattern from the parts
                      of the video that are very dark or very still.

                 window=<numframes>
                      Set the number of past frames to look at when  searching
                      for  pattern  (default: 30).  Longer window improves the
                      reliability of the pattern search,  but  shorter  window
                      improves  the  reaction  time  to  the  changes  in  the
                      telecine phase.  This only affects the  one  pass  mode.
                      The  two  pass mode currently uses fixed window that ex‐
                      tends to both future and past.

                 phase=0|1|2|3|4
                      Sets the initial telecine phase for one pass  mode  (de‐
                      fault:  0).  The two pass mode can see the future, so it
                      is able to use the correct phase from the beginning, but
                      one  pass  mode  can only guess.  It catches the correct
                      phase when it finds it, but this option can be  used  to
                      fix  the possible juddering at the beginning.  The first
                      pass of the two pass mode also uses this, so if you save
                      the  output  from the first pass, you get constant phase
                      result.

                 deghost=<value>
                      Set the deghosting threshold (0-255 for one  pass  mode,
                      -255-255  for  two  pass  mode, default 0).  If nonzero,
                      deghosting mode is used.  This is  for  video  that  has
                      been  deinterlaced  by  blending the fields together in‐
                      stead of dropping one of the fields.  Deghosting  ampli‐
                      fies any compression artifacts in the blended frames, so
                      the parameter value is used as a  threshold  to  exclude
                      those pixels from deghosting that differ from the previ‐
                      ous frame less than specified value.  If two  pass  mode
                      is  used,  then  negative  value can be used to make the
                      filter analyze the  whole  video  in  the  beginning  of
                      pass-2  to  determine whether it needs deghosting or not
                      and then select either zero or the absolute value of the
                      parameter.   Specify this option for pass-2, it makes no
                      difference on pass-1.

       phase[=t|b|p|a|u|T|B|A|U][:v]
              Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order
              changes.   The  intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been
              captured with the opposite  field  order  to  the  film-to-video
              transfer.  The options are:

                 t    Capture  field  order  top-first, transfer bottom-first.
                      Filter will delay the bottom field.

                 b    Capture bottom-first, transfer top-first.   Filter  will
                      delay the top field.

                 p    Capture  and  transfer  with the same field order.  This
                      mode only exists for the documentation of the other  op‐
                      tions  to  refer  to, but if you actually select it, the
                      filter will faithfully do nothing ;-)

                 a    Capture field order determined  automatically  by  field
                      flags,  transfer opposite.  Filter selects among t and b
                      modes on a frame by frame basis using field  flags.   If
                      no  field information is available, then this works just
                      like u.

                 u    Capture unknown or varying, transfer  opposite.   Filter
                      selects  among t and b on a frame by frame basis by ana‐
                      lyzing the images and  selecting  the  alternative  that
                      produces best match between the fields.

                 T    Capture  top-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter
                      selects among t and p using image analysis.

                 B    Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Fil‐
                      ter selects among b and p using image analysis.

                 A    Capture  determined  by field flags, transfer unknown or
                      varying.  Filter selects among t, b and  p  using  field
                      flags  and  image  analysis.  If no field information is
                      available, then this works just like U.  This is the de‐
                      fault mode.

                 U    Both  capture  and  transfer unknown or varying.  Filter
                      selects among t, b and p using image analysis only.

                 v    Verbose operation.  Prints the selected  mode  for  each
                      frame  and the average squared difference between fields
                      for t, b, and p alternatives.

       telecine[=start]
              Apply 3:2 ’telecine’ process to increase framerate by 20%.  This
              most  likely will not work correctly with MPlayer, but it can be
              used  with  ’mencoder  -fps  30000/1001  -ofps  30000/1001   -vf
              telecine’.   Both  fps  options  are  essential!  (A/V sync will
              break if they are wrong.)  The optional  start  parameter  tells
              the filter where in the telecine pattern to start (0-3).

       tinterlace[=mode]
              Temporal  field  interlacing - merge pairs of frames into an in‐
              terlaced frame, halving the framerate.  Even  frames  are  moved
              into  the  upper field, odd frames to the lower field.  This can
              be used to fully reverse the effect of the  tfields  filter  (in
              mode 0).  Available modes are:
                 0    Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the low‐
                      er field, generating a full-height frame at half framer‐
                      ate.
                 1    Only  output odd frames, even frames are dropped; height
                      unchanged.
                 2    Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped;  height
                      unchanged.
                 3    Expand  each  frame  to  full  height, but pad alternate
                      lines with black; framerate unchanged.
                 4    Interleave even lines from even frames  with  odd  lines
                      from odd frames.  Height unchanged at half framerate.

       tfields[=mode[:field_dominance]]
              Temporal  field  separation - split fields into frames, doubling
              the output framerate.  Like the telecine  filter,  tfields  will
              only work properly with MEncoder, and only if both -fps and -of‐
              ps are set to the desired (double) framerate!
                 <mode>
                      0: Leave fields unchanged (will jump/flicker).
                      1: Interpolate missing lines. (The algorithm used  might
                      not be so good.)
                      2:  Translate fields by 1/4 pixel with linear interpola‐
                      tion (no jump).
                      4: Translate fields by 1/4 pixel with 4tap filter (high‐
                      er quality) (default).
                 <field_dominance> (DEPRECATED)
                      -1: auto (default) Only works if the decoder exports the
                      appropriate information and no other filters which  dis‐
                      card  that information come before tfields in the filter
                      chain, otherwise it falls back to 0 (top field first).
                      0: top field first
                      1: bottom field first
                      NOTE: This option will possibly be removed in  a  future
                      version.  Use -field-dominance instead.

       yadif=[mode[:field_dominance]]
              Yet another deinterlacing filter
                 <mode>
                      0: Output 1 frame for each frame.
                      1: Output 1 frame for each field.
                      2: Like 0 but skips spatial interlacing check.
                      3: Like 1 but skips spatial interlacing check.
                 <field_dominance> (DEPRECATED)
                      Operates like tfields.
                      NOTE:  This  option will possibly be removed in a future
                      version.  Use -field-dominance instead.

       mcdeint=[mode[:parity[:qp]]]
              Motion compensating deinterlacer.  It needs one field per  frame
              as  input  and  must  thus  be  used  together with tfields=1 or
              yadif=1/3 or equivalent.
                 <mode>
                      0: fast
                      1: medium
                      2: slow, iterative motion estimation
                      3: extra slow, like 2 plus multiple reference frames
                 <parity>
                      0 or 1 selects which field to use (note:  no  autodetec‐
                      tion yet!).
                 <qp>
                      Higher  values should result in a smoother motion vector
                      field but less optimal individual vectors.

       bmovl=hidden:opaque:fifo
              The bitmap overlay filter reads bitmaps from a FIFO and displays
              them  on  top of the movie, allowing some transformations on the
              image.  Also see TOOLS/bmovl-test.c for a small bmovl test  pro‐
              gram.

                      Set  the  default value of the ’hidden’ flag (0=visible,
                      1=hidden).

                 OPAQUE
                      Disable all alpha transparency.  Send "ALPHA 0 0 0 0  0"
                      to enable it again.
                 HIDE
                      Hide bitmap.
                 SHOW
                      Show bitmap.

              Arguments are:
                 <width>, <height>
                      image/area size
                 <xpos>, <ypos>
                      Start blitting at position x/y.
                 <alpha>
                      Set  alpha  difference.  If you set this to -255 you can
                      then send a sequence of ALPHA-commands to set  the  area
                      to -225, -200, -175 etc for a nice fade-in-effect! ;)
                         0:    same as original
                         255:  Make everything opaque.
                         -255: Make everything transparent.

                 <clear>
                      Clear the framebuffer before blitting.
                         0:  The  image will just be blitted on top of the old
                         one, so you do not need to send 1.8MB of RGBA32  data
                         every time a small part of the screen is updated.
                         1: clear

       framestep=I|[i]step
              Renders only every nth frame or every intra frame (keyframe).

              If you call the filter with I (uppercase) as the parameter, then
              only keyframes are rendered.  For DVDs it generally means one in
              every  15/12  frames  (IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB),  for AVI it means every
              scene change or every keyint value (see -lavcopts keyint=  value
              if you use MEncoder to encode the video).

              When  a  keyframe is found, an ’I!’ string followed by a newline
              character is printed, leaving the current line  of  MPlayer/MEn‐
              coder  output  on  the  screen, because it contains the time (in
              seconds) and frame number of the keyframe (You can use this  in‐
              formation to split the AVI.).

              If you call the filter with a numeric parameter ’step’ then only
              one in every ’step’ frames is rendered.

              If you put an ’i’ (lowercase) before the number then an ’I!’  is
              printed (like the I parameter).

              If  you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames, only
              I! is printed.

       tile=xtiles:ytiles:output:start:delta
              Tile a series of images into a single,  bigger  image.   If  you
              omit  a  parameter  or use a value less than 0, then the default
              value is used.  You can also stop when you  are  satisfied  (...
              -vf tile=10:5 ...).  It is probably a good idea to put the scale
              filter before the tile :-)

              The parameters are:

                 <xtiles>
                      number of tiles on the x axis (default: 5)
                 <ytiles>
                      number of tiles on the y axis (default: 5)
                 <output>
                      Render the tile  when  ’output’  number  of  frames  are
                      reached,  where  ’output’  should  be a number less than
                      xtile * ytile.   Missing  tiles  are  left  blank.   You
                      could,  for example, write an 8 * 7 tile every 50 frames
                      to have one image every 2 seconds @ 25 fps.
                 <start>
                      outer border thickness in pixels (default: 2)
                 <delta>
                      inner border thickness in pixels (default: 4)

       delogo[=x:y:w:h:t]
              Suppresses a TV station logo by a simple  interpolation  of  the
              surrounding  pixels.  Just set a rectangle covering the logo and
              watch it disappear (and sometimes something even uglier appear -
              your mileage may vary).
                 <x>,<y>
                      top left corner of the logo
                 <w>,<h>
                      width and height of the cleared rectangle
                 <t>  Thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to w
                      and h).  When set to -1, a green rectangle is  drawn  on
                      the screen to simplify finding the right x,y,w,h parame‐
                      ters.

       remove-logo=/path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
              Suppresses a TV station logo, using a PGM or PPM image  file  to
              determine  which pixels comprise the logo.  The width and height
              of the image file must match those of  the  video  stream  being
              processed.   Uses the filter image and a circular blur algorithm
              to remove the logo.

                 /path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
                      [path] + filename of the filter image.

       zrmjpeg[=options]
              Software YV12 to MJPEG encoder for use with the zr2 video output
              device.

                 maxheight=<h>|maxwidth=<w>
                      These  options  set  the maximum width and height the zr
                      card can handle (the MPlayer filter layer currently can‐
                      not query those).

                 {dc10+,dc10,buz,lml33}-{PAL|NTSC}
                      Use these options to set maxwidth and maxheight automat‐
                      ically to the values known for card/mode combo.  For ex‐
                      ample,  valid  options  are:  dc10-PAL and buz-NTSC (de‐
                      fault: dc10+PAL)

                 color|bw
                      Select color or black and  white  encoding.   Black  and
                      white encoding is faster.  Color is the default.

                 hdec={1,2,4}
                      Horizontal decimation 1, 2 or 4.

                 vdec={1,2,4}
                      Vertical decimation 1, 2 or 4.

                 quality=1-20
                      Set JPEG compression quality [BEST] 1 - 20 [VERY BAD].

                 fd|nofd
                      By  default,  decimation  is only performed if the Zoran
                      hardware can upscale the resulting MJPEG images  to  the
                      original  size.   The  option fd instructs the filter to
                      always perform the requested decimation (ugly).

       screenshot
              Allows acquiring screenshots of the movie using slave mode  com‐
              mands that can be bound to keypresses.  See the slave mode docu‐
              mentation and  the  INTERACTIVE  CONTROL  section  for  details.
              Files named ’shotNNNN.png’ will be saved in the working directo‐
              ry, using the first available number - no files  will  be  over‐
              written.   The  filter has no overhead when not used and accepts
              an arbitrary colorspace, so it is safe to add it to the configu‐
              ration file.

       ass
              Moves  SSA/ASS  subtitle  rendering to an arbitrary point in the
              filter chain.  Only useful with the -ass option.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vf ass,screenshot
                      Moves SSA/ASS rendering before  the  screenshot  filter.
                      Screenshots taken this way will contain subtitles.

       blackframe[=amount:threshold]
              Detect frames that are (almost) completely black.  Can be useful
              to detect chapter transitions or commercials.  Output lines con‐
              sist  of  the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage
              of blackness, the frame type and the frame number  of  the  last
              encountered keyframe.

                 <amount>
                      Percentage  of  the  pixels  that  have  to be below the
                      threshold (default: 98).

                 <threshold>
                      Threshold below which a pixel value is considered  black
                      (default: 32).

GENERAL ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
       -audio-delay <any floating-point number>
              Delays  either  audio  or  video by setting a delay field in the
              header (default: 0.0).  This does not delay either stream  while
              encoding, but the player will see the delay field and compensate
              accordingly.  Positive values delay the audio, and negative val‐
              ues  delay  the  video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of
              the -delay option.  For example, if a video plays correctly with
              -delay 0.2, you can fix the video with MEncoder by using -audio-
              delay -0.2.

              Currently, this option only works with the  default  muxer  (-of
              avi).   If  you  are  using a different muxer, then you must use
              -delay instead.

       -audio-density <1-50>
              Number of audio chunks per second (default is 2  for  0.5s  long
              audio chunks).
              NOTE: CBR only, VBR ignores this as it puts each packet in a new
              chunk.

       -audio-preload <0.0-2.0>
              Sets up the audio buffering time interval (default: 0.5s).

       -fafmttag <format>
              Can be used to override the audio format tag of the output file.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -fafmttag 0x55
                      Will  have  the  output file contain 0x55 (mp3) as audio
                      format tag.

       -ffourcc <fourcc>
              Can be used to override the video fourcc of the output file.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ffourcc div3
                      Will have the output file contain ’div3’ as video  four‐
                      cc.

       -force-avi-aspect <0.2-3.0>
              Override the aspect stored in the AVI OpenDML vprp header.  This
              can be used to change the aspect ratio with ’-ovc copy’.

       -frameno-file <filename> (DEPRECATED)
              Specify the name of the audio  file  with  framenumber  mappings
              created  in  the first (audio only) pass of a special three pass
              encoding mode.
              NOTE: Using this mode will most likely give you A-V desync.   Do
              not  use  it.   It  is kept for backwards compatibility only and
              will possibly be removed in a future version.

       -hr-edl-seek
              Use a more precise, but much slower method for  skipping  areas.
              Areas  marked  for  skipping  are  not  seeked over, instead all
              frames are decoded, but only the necessary frames  are  encoded.
              This allows starting at non-keyframe boundaries.
              NOTE: Not guaranteed to work right with ’-ovc copy’.

       -info <option1:option2:...> (AVI only)
              Specify the info header of the resulting AVI file.

              Available options are:

       -noautoexpand
              Do  not automatically insert the expand filter into the MEncoder
              filter chain.  Useful to control at which point  of  the  filter
              chain  subtitles  are  rendered when hardcoding subtitles onto a
              movie.

       -noencodedups
              Do not attempt to encode duplicate frames in  duplicate;  always
              output  zero-byte  frames  to  indicate  duplicates.   Zero-byte
              frames will be written anyway unless a filter or encoder capable
              of  doing duplicate encoding is loaded.  Currently the only such
              filter is harddup.

       -noodml (-of avi only)
              Do not write OpenDML index for AVI files >1GB.

       -noskip
              Do not skip frames.

       -o <filename>
              Outputs to the given filename.
              If you want a default output filename, you can put  this  option
              in the MEncoder config file.

       -oac <codec name>
              Encode with the given audio codec (no default set).
              NOTE: Use -oac help to get a list of available audio codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -oac copy
                      no encoding, just streamcopy
                 -oac pcm
                      Encode to uncompressed PCM.
                 -oac mp3lame
                      Encode to MP3 (using LAME).
                 -oac lavc
                      Encode with a libavcodec codec.

       -of <format> (BETA CODE!)
              Encode to the specified container format (default: AVI).
              NOTE: Use -of help to get a list of available container formats.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -of avi
                      Encode to AVI.
                 -of mpeg
                      Encode to MPEG (also see -mpegopts).
                 -of lavf
                      Encode with libavformat muxers (also see -lavfopts).
                 -of rawvideo
                      raw video stream (no muxing - one video stream only)
                 -of rawaudio
                      raw audio stream (no muxing - one audio stream only)

       -ofps <fps>
              Specify a frames per second (fps) value  for  the  output  file,
              which  can  be different from that of the source material.  Must
              be  set  for  variable  fps  (ASF,  some  MOV)  and  progressive
              (30000/1001 fps telecined MPEG) files.

       -ovc <codec name>
              Encode with the given video codec (no default set).
              NOTE: Use -ovc help to get a list of available video codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ovc copy
                      no encoding, just streamcopy
                 -ovc raw
                      Encode  to  an  arbitrary  uncompressed format (use ’-vf
                      format’ to select).
                 -ovc lavc
                      Encode with a libavcodec codec.

       -passlogfile <filename>
              Dump first pass information to <filename> instead of the default
              divx2pass.log in two pass encoding mode.

       -skiplimit <value>
              Specify  the  maximum number of frames that may be skipped after
              encoding one frame (-noskiplimit for unlimited).

       -vobsubout <basename>
              Specify the basename for the output .idx and .sub  files.   This
              turns off subtitle rendering in the encoded movie and diverts it
              to VOBsub subtitle files.

       -vobsuboutid <langid>
              Specify the language two letter code for  the  subtitles.   This
              overrides what is read from the DVD or the .ifo file.

       -vobsuboutindex <index>
              Specify the index of the subtitles in the output files (default:
              0).

CODEC SPECIFIC ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
       You can specify codec specific encoding parameters using the  following
       syntax:

       -<codec>opts <option1[=value],option2,...>

       Where <codec> may be: lavc, xvidenc, lame, toolame, twolame, nuv, xvfw,
       faac, x264enc, mpeg, lavf.

              results in slightly lower quality and higher bitrates.

       highpassfreq=<freq>
              Set a highpass filtering frequency in Hz.  Frequencies below the
              specified  one will be cut off.  A value of -1 will disable fil‐
              tering, a value of 0 will let LAME choose values  automatically.

       lowpassfreq=<freq>
              Set  a lowpass filtering frequency in Hz.  Frequencies above the
              specified one will be cut off.  A value of -1 will disable  fil‐
              tering,  a value of 0 will let LAME choose values automatically.

       br=<32-384>
              In  CBR  mode this parameter indicates the bitrate in kbps, when
              in VBR mode it is the minimum bitrate allowed  per  frame.   VBR
              mode will not work with a value below 112.

       vbr=<-50-50> (VBR only)
              variability  range;  if  negative the encoder shifts the average
              bitrate towards the lower limit, if positive towards the higher.
              When set to 0 CBR is used (default).

       raw
              Stores the bitstream as raw payload with extradata in  the  con‐
              tainer  header  (default:  0,  corresponds to ADTS).  Do not set

       atag=<value>
              Use the specified Windows audio format tag (e.g. atag=0x55).

       bit_exact
              Use only bit exact  algorithms  (except  (I)DCT).   Additionally
              bit_exact disables several optimizations and thus should only be
              used for regression tests, which  need  binary  identical  files
              even  if  the encoder version changes.  This also suppresses the
              user_data header in MPEG-4 streams.  Do not use this option  un‐
              less you know exactly what you are doing.

       threads=<1-8>
              Maximum  number  of  threads  to  use  (default: 1).  May have a
              slight negative effect on motion estimation.

       vqmin=<1-31>
              minimum quantizer (pass 1/2)

                 1    Not recommended (much larger file, little  quality  dif‐
                      ference  and  weird  side effects: msmpeg4, h263 will be
                      very low quality, ratecontrol will be confused resulting
                      in  lower  quality and some decoders will not be able to
                      decode it).

                 2    Recommended for normal  mpeg4/mpeg1video  encoding  (de‐
                      fault).

                 3    Recommended for h263(p)/msmpeg4.  The reason for prefer‐
                      ring 3 over 2 is that 2 could lead to overflows.   (This
                      will  be fixed for h263(p) by changing the quantizer per
                      MB in the future, msmpeg4 cannot be fixed as it does not
                      support that.)

       lmin=<0.01-255.0>
              Minimum  frame-level  Lagrange  multiplier  for ratecontrol (de‐
              fault: 2.0).  Lavc will rarely use quantizers below the value of
              lmin.   Lowering lmin will make lavc more likely to choose lower
              quantizers for some frames, but not  lower  than  the  value  of
              vqmin.   Likewise,  raising  lmin  will make lavc less likely to
              choose low quantizers, even if vqmin would  have  allowed  them.
              You  probably  want  to  set  lmin approximately equal to vqmin.
              When adaptive quantization is in  use,  changing  lmin/lmax  may
              have less of an effect; see mblmin/mblmax.

       lmax=<0.01-255.0>
              maximum Lagrange multiplier for ratecontrol (default: 31.0)

       mblmin=<0.01-255.0>
              Minimum  macroblock-level  Lagrange  multiplier  for ratecontrol
              (default:2.0).  This parameter affects adaptive quantization op‐
              tions like qprd, lumi_mask, etc..

       mblmax=<0.01-255.0>
              Maximum  macroblock-level  Lagrange  multiplier  for ratecontrol
              (default: 31.0).

       vqscale=<0-31>
              Constant quantizer / constant quality  encoding  (selects  fixed
              quantizer  mode).  A lower value means better quality but larger
              files (default: -1).  In case of snow codec, value 0 means loss‐
              less encoding.  Since the other codecs do not support this, vqs‐
              cale=0 will have an undefined effect.  1 is not recommended (see
              vqmin for details).

       vqmax=<1-31>
              Maximum  quantizer (pass 1/2), 10-31 should be a sane range (de‐
              fault: 31).

       mbqmin=<1-31>
              obsolete, use vqmin

       mbqmax=<1-31>
              obsolete, use vqmax

       vqdiff=<1-31>
              maximum quantizer difference between consecutive I- or  P-frames
              (pass 1/2) (default: 3)

       vmax_b_frames=<0-4>
              maximum number of B-frames between non-B-frames:
                 0    no B-frames (default)
                 0-2  sane range for MPEG-4

       vme=<0-5>
              motion estimation method.  Available methods are:
                 0    none (very low quality)
                 1    full (slow, currently unmaintained and disabled)
                 2    log (low quality, currently unmaintained and disabled)
                 3    phods (low quality, currently unmaintained and disabled)
                 4    EPZS: size=1 diamond, size can be adjusted with the *dia
                      options (default)
                 5    X1 (experimental, currently aliased to EPZS)
                 8    iter (iterative overlapped block, only used in snow)

              NOTE: 0-3 currently ignores the amount of bits spent, so quality
              may be low.

       me_range=<0-9999>
              motion estimation search range (default: 0 (unlimited))

       mbd=<0-2> (see also *cmp, qpel)
              Macroblock decision algorithm (high quality mode),  encode  each
              macro  block in all modes and choose the best.  This is slow but
              results in better quality and file size.  When mbd is set  to  1
              or  2, the value of mbcmp is ignored when comparing macroblocks.
              If any comparison setting (precmp, subcmp,  cmp,  or  mbcmp)  is
              nonzero,  however,  a  slower  but better half-pel motion search
              will be used, regardless of what mbd is set to.  If qpel is set,
              quarter-pel motion search will be used regardless.
                 0    Use comparison function given by mbcmp (default).
                 1    Select the MB mode which needs the fewest bits (=vhq).
                 2    Select the MB mode which has the best rate distortion.

       vhq
              Same as mbd=1, kept for compatibility reasons.

       v4mv
              Allow 4 motion vectors per macroblock (slightly better quality).
              Works better if used with mbd>0.

       obmc
              overlapped block motion compensation (H.263+)

       loop
              loop filter (H.263+) note, this is broken

       inter_threshold <-1000-1000>
              Does absolutely nothing at the moment.

       keyint=<0-300>
              maximum interval between keyframes in frames  (default:  250  or
              one  keyframe  every  ten seconds in a 25fps movie.  This is the
              recommended default for MPEG-4).  Most  codecs  require  regular
              keyframes  in order to limit the accumulation of mismatch error.
              Keyframes are also needed for seeking, as seeking is only possi‐
              ble  to  a  keyframe  - but keyframes need more space than other
              frames, so larger numbers here mean slightly smaller  files  but
              less  precise  seeking.  0 is equivalent to 1, which makes every
              frame a keyframe.  Values >300 are not recommended as the quali‐
              ty might be bad depending upon decoder, encoder and luck.  It is
              a common for MPEG-1/2 to use values <=30.

       sc_threshold=<-1000000000-1000000000>
              Threshold for scene change detection.  A keyframe is inserted by
              libavcodec  when it detects a scene change.  You can specify the
              sensitivity of the  detection  with  this  option.   -1000000000
              means   there  is  a  scene  change  detected  at  every  frame,
              1000000000 means no scene changes are detected (default: 0).

       sc_factor=<any positive integer>
              Causes frames with higher quantizers to be more likely to  trig‐
              ger  a scene change detection and make libavcodec use an I-frame
              (default: 1).  1-16 is a sane range.  Values between 2 and 6 may
              yield  increasing  PSNR (up to approximately 0.04 dB) and better
              placement of I-frames in high-motion scenes.  Higher values than
              6 may give very slightly better PSNR (approximately 0.01 dB more
              than sc_factor=6), but noticably worse visual quality.

       vb_strategy=<0-2> (pass one only)
              strategy to choose between I/P/B-frames:
                 0    Always use the maximum number of B-frames (default).
                 1    Avoid B-frames in high motion scenes.  See the  b_sensi‐
                      tivity option to tune this strategy.
                 2    Places  B-frames more or less optimally to yield maximum
                      quality (slower).  You may want to reduce the speed  im‐
                      pact of this option by tuning the option brd_scale.

       b_sensitivity=<any integer greater than 0>
              Adjusts  how sensitively vb_strategy=1 detects motion and avoids
              using B-frames (default: 40).  Lower sensitivities  will  result
              in  more  B-frames.   Using more B-frames usually improves PSNR,
              but too many B-frames can hurt quality  in  high-motion  scenes.
              Unless there is an extremely high amount of motion, b_sensitivi‐
              ty can safely be lowered below the default; 10 is  a  reasonable
              value in most cases.

       brd_scale=<0-10>
              Downscales  frames  for  dynamic  B-frame decision (default: 0).
              Each time brd_scale is increased by one,  the  frame  dimensions
              are  divided  by  two, which improves speed by a factor of four.
              Both dimensions of the fully downscaled frame must be even  num‐
              bers, so brd_scale=1 requires the original dimensions to be mul‐
              tiples of four, brd_scale=2 requires multiples  of  eight,  etc.
              In  other  words, the dimensions of the original frame must both
              be divisible by 2^(brd_scale+1) with no remainder.

       bidir_refine=<0-4>
              Refine the two motion vectors used in bidirectional macroblocks,
              rather  than  re-using  vectors  from  the  forward and backward

       vpass=<1-3>
              Activates internal two (or more) pass mode, only specify if  you
              wish to use two (or more) pass encoding.
                 1    first pass (also see turbo)
                 2    second pass
                 3    Nth  pass (second and subsequent passes of N-pass encod‐
                      ing)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The first pass (vpass=1) writes the statistics file.  You  might
              want  to  deactivate  some CPU-hungry options, like "turbo" mode
              does.
              In two pass mode, the second pass (vpass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In  N-pass  mode,  the second pass (vpass=3, that is not a typo)
              does both: It first reads the statistics, then overwrites  them.
              You  might  want  to  backup  divx2pass.log before doing this if
              there is any possibility that you will have to cancel  MEncoder.
              You can use all encoding options, except very CPU-hungry options
              like "qns".
              You can run this same pass over and over to refine  the  encode.
              Each  subsequent  pass will use the statistics from the previous
              pass to improve.  The final pass can include any CPU-hungry  en‐
              coding options.
              If  you  want  a  2  pass  encode,  use  first vpass=1, and then
              vpass=2.
              If you want a 3 or more pass encode, use vpass=1 for  the  first
              pass and then vpass=3 and then vpass=3 again and again until you
              are satisfied with the encode.

              huffyuv:
                 pass 1
                      Saves statistics.
                 pass 2
                      Encodes with an optimal Huffman table based upon statis‐
                      tics from the first pass.

       turbo (two pass only)
              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and dis‐
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will probably reduce  global
              PSNR  a  little  bit (around 0.01dB) and change individual frame
              type and PSNR a little bit more (up to 0.03dB).

       aspect=<x/y>
              Store movie aspect internally, just like with MPEG files.   Much
              nicer  than  rescaling,  because quality is not decreased.  Only
              MPlayer will play these files correctly, other players will dis‐
              play  them with wrong aspect.  The aspect parameter can be given
              as a ratio or a floating point number.

              EXAMPLE:
                 aspect=16/9 or aspect=1.78

       autoaspect
              Same as the aspect option, but  automatically  computes  aspect,
              taking into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.)
              made in the filter chain.  Does not incur a performance penalty,
              so you can safely leave it always on.

       vqcomp=<0.0-1.0>
              Quantizer compression, vrc_eq depends upon this (pass 1/2)  (de‐
              fault:  0.5).   For  instance, assuming the default rate control
              equation is used, if vqcomp=1.0, the  ratecontrol  allocates  to
              each  frame  the number of bits needed to encode them all at the
              same QP.  If vqcomp=0.0, the ratecontrol allocates the same num‐
              ber of bits to each frame, i.e. strict CBR.  NOTE: Those are ex‐
              treme settings and should never  be  used.   Perceptual  quality
              will be optimal somewhere in between these two extremes.

              Data  partitioning.  Adds 2 Bytes per video packet, improves er‐
              ror-resistance when transferring over unreliable channels  (e.g.
              streaming over the internet).  Each video packet will be encoded
              in 3 separate partitions:
                 1. MVs

                      details
              MV & DC are most important, losing them  looks  far  worse  than
              losing  the  AC  and  the  1. & 2. partition.  (MV & DC) are far
              smaller than the 3. partition (AC) meaning that errors will  hit
              the  AC  partition  much more often than the MV & DC partitions.
              Thus, the picture will look better with partitioning than  with‐
              out, as without partitioning an error will trash AC/DC/MV equal‐
              ly.

              Luminance masking is a ’psychosensory’ setting that is  supposed

              time to see all the bird’s  details.   Be  warned  that  if  the
              masked  object  stops (e.g. the bird lands) it is likely to look
              horrible for a short period of time, until the  encoder  figures
              out that the object is not moving and needs refined blocks.  The
              saved bits will be spent on other parts of the video, which  may
              increase  subjective  quality, provided that tcplx_mask is care‐
              fully chosen.

       scplx_mask=<0.0-1.0>
              Spatial complexity masking.  Larger values help against  blocki‐
              ness,  if  no  deblocking  filter is used for decoding, which is
              maybe not a good idea.
              Imagine a scene with grass (which usually has great spatial com‐
              plexity),  a  blue  sky  and  a house; scplx_mask will raise the
              quantizers of the grass’ macroblocks, thus decreasing its quali‐
              ty, in order to spend more bits on the sky and the house.
              HINT:  Crop any black borders completely as they will reduce the
              quality of the macroblocks (also applies without scplx_mask).
                 0.0
                      disabled (default)
                 0.0-0.5
                      sane range

              NOTE: This setting does not have the same effect as using a cus‐
              tom  matrix  that would compress high frequencies harder, as sc‐
              plx_mask will reduce the quality of P blocks even if only DC  is
              changing.   The  result  of scplx_mask will probably not look as
              good.

       p_mask=<0.0-1.0> (also see vi_qfactor)
              Reduces the quality of inter blocks.  This is equivalent to  in‐
              creasing  the  quality of intra blocks, because the same average
              bitrate will be distributed by the rate controller to the  whole
              video  sequence  (default:  0.0 (disabled)).  p_mask=1.0 doubles
              the bits allocated to each intra block.

       border_mask=<0.0-1.0>
              border-processing for MPEG-style  encoders.   Border  processing
              increases  the  quantizer  for  macroblocks  which are less than
              1/5th of the frame width/height  away  from  the  frame  border,
              since they are often visually less important.

       naq
              Normalize  adaptive  quantization  (experimental).   When  using
              adaptive quantization (*_mask), the average per-MB quantizer may
              no  longer  match the requested frame-level quantizer.  Naq will
              attempt to adjust the per-MB quantizers to maintain  the  proper
              average.

       ildct
              Use interlaced DCT.

       ilme

              mbcmp for available comparison functions) (default: 0).

       subcmp=<0-2000>
              Sets the comparison function for sub pel motion estimation  (see
              mbcmp for available comparison functions) (default: 0).

       nssew=<0-1000000>
              This setting controls NSSE weight, where larger weights will re‐
              sult in more noise.  0 NSSE is identical to  SSE  You  may  find
              this  useful  if  you  prefer to keep some noise in your encoded
              video rather than filtering it away  before  encoding  (default:
              8).

       predia=<-99-6>
              diamond type and size for motion estimation pre-pass

       dia=<-99-6>
              Diamond  type & size for motion estimation.  Motion search is an
              iterative process.  Using a small diamond  does  not  limit  the
              search  to  finding only small motion vectors.  It is just some‐
              what more likely to stop before finding  the  very  best  motion
              vector,  especially when noise is involved.  Bigger diamonds al‐
              low a wider search for the best motion vector, thus  are  slower
              but result in better quality.
              Big  normal diamonds are better quality than shape-adaptive dia‐
              monds.
              Shape-adaptive diamonds are a good tradeoff  between  speed  and
              quality.
              NOTE:  The  sizes of the normal diamonds and shape adaptive ones
              do not have the same meaning.

       trell
              Trellis searched quantization.  This will find the  optimal  en‐
              coding  for  each  8x8  block.  Trellis searched quantization is
              quite simply an optimal quantization in the PSNR versus  bitrate
              sense  (Assuming  that  there would be no rounding errors intro‐
              duced by the IDCT, which is obviously not the case.).  It simply
              finds a block for the minimum of error and lambda*bits.
                 lambda
                      quantization parameter (QP) dependent constant
                 bits
                      amount of bits needed to encode the block
                 error
                      sum of squared errors of the quantization

       cbp
              Rate  distorted  optimal  coded  block pattern.  Will select the
              coded block pattern which minimizes  distortion  +  lambda*rate.
              This can only be used together with trellis quantization.

       mv0
              Try  to  encode each MB with MV=<0,0> and choose the better one.
              This has no effect if mbd=0.

       mv0_threshold=<any non-negative integer>
              When surrounding motion vectors are <0,0> and the motion estima‐
              tion  score  of  the  current  block is less than mv0_threshold,
              <0,0> is used for the motion vector and further  motion  estima‐
              tion is skipped (default: 256).  Lowering mv0_threshold to 0 can
              give a slight (0.01dB) PSNR increase and possibly make  the  en‐
              coded video look slightly better; raising mv0_threshold past 320
              results in diminished PSNR and visual  quality.   Higher  values
              speed up encoding very slightly (usually less than 1%, depending
              on the other options used).
              NOTE: This option does not require mv0 to be enabled.

       qprd (mbd=2 only)
              rate distorted optimal quantization parameter (QP) for the given
              lambda of each macroblock

       last_pred=<0-99>
              amount of motion predictors from the previous frame
                 0    (default)
                 a    Will  use 2a+1 x 2a+1 macroblock square of motion vector
                      predictors from the previous frame.

       subq=<1-8>
              subpel refinement quality (for qpel) (default: 8 (high quality))
              NOTE: This has a significant effect on speed.

       refs=<1-8>
              number  of  reference frames to consider for motion compensation
              (Snow only) (default: 1)

       psnr
              print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole  video
              after  encoding  and  store  the per frame PSNR in a file with a
              name like ’psnr_hhmmss.log’.  Returned values are in  dB  (deci‐
              bel), the higher the better.

       mpeg_quant
              Use MPEG quantizers instead of H.263.

       aic
              Enable AC prediction for MPEG-4 or advanced intra prediction for
              H.263+.  This will improve quality very slightly (around 0.02 dB
              PSNR) and slow down encoding very slightly (about 1%).
              NOTE: vqmin should be 8 or larger for H.263+ AIC.

       aiv
              alternative inter vlc for H.263+

       umv
              unlimited  MVs (H.263+ only) Allows encoding of arbitrarily long
              MVs.

       ibias=<-256-256>
              intra quantizer bias (256 equals 1.0, MPEG style  quantizer  de‐
              fault: 96, H.263 style quantizer default: 0)
              NOTE: The H.263 MMX quantizer cannot handle positive biases (set
              vfdct=1 or 2), the MPEG MMX quantizer cannot handle negative bi‐
              ases (set vfdct=1 or 2).

       pbias=<-256-256>
              inter  quantizer  bias (256 equals 1.0, MPEG style quantizer de‐
              fault: 0, H.263 style quantizer default: -64)
              NOTE: The H.263 MMX quantizer cannot handle positive biases (set
              vfdct=1 or 2), the MPEG MMX quantizer cannot handle negative bi‐
              ases (set vfdct=1 or 2).
              HINT: A more positive bias (-32 - -16 instead of -64)  seems  to
              improve the PSNR.

       nr=<0-100000>
              Noise  reduction, 0 means disabled.  0-600 is a useful range for
              typical content, but you may want to turn it up a bit  more  for
              very  noisy  content  (default:  0).   Given its small impact on
              speed, you might want to prefer to use this over filtering noise
              away with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

       qns=<0-3>
              Quantizer  noise  shaping.  Rather than choosing quantization to
              most closely match the source video in the PSNR sense, it choos‐
              es quantization such that noise (usually ringing) will be masked
              by similar-frequency content in the image.   Larger  values  are
              slower  but  may  not  result  in  better quality.  This can and
              should be used together with trellis quantization, in which case
              the  trellis  quantization (optimal for constant weight) will be
              used as startpoint for the iterative search.
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    Only lower the absolute value of coefficients.
                 2    Only change coefficients before the last non-zero  coef‐
                      ficient + 1.

       inter_matrix=<comma separated matrix>
              Use  custom  inter matrix.  It needs a comma separated string of
              64 integers.

       intra_matrix=<comma separated matrix>
              Use custom intra matrix.  It needs a comma separated  string  of
              64 integers.

       vqmod_amp
              experimental quantizer modulation

       vqmod_freq
              experimental quantizer modulation

       dc
              intra  DC  precision  in  bits  (default:  8).   If  you specify
              vcodec=mpeg2video this value can be 8, 9, 10 or 11.

       cgop (also see sc_threshold)
              Close all GOPs.  Currently it only works if scene change  detec‐
              tion is disabled (sc_threshold=1000000000).

       vglobal=<0-3>
              Control writing global video headers.
                 0    Codec decides where to write global headers (default).
                 1    Write  global  headers  only  in  extradata  (needed for
                      .mp4/MOV/NUT).
                 2    Write global headers only in front of keyframes.
                 3    Combine 1 and 2.

       aglobal=<0-3>
              Same as vglobal for audio headers.

       level=<value>
              Set CodecContext Level.  Use  31  or  41  to  play  video  on  a
              Playstation 3.

   nuv (-nuvopts)
       Nuppel  video  is based on RTJPEG and LZO.  By default frames are first
       encoded with RTJPEG and then compressed with LZO, but it is possible to
       disable either or both of the two passes.  As a result, you can in fact
       output raw i420, LZO compressed i420, RTJPEG, or the default  LZO  com‐
       pressed RTJPEG.
       NOTE:  The nuvrec documentation contains some advice and examples about
       the settings to use for the most common TV encodings.

       c=<0-20>
              chrominance threshold (default: 1)

       l=<0-20>

       lzo
              Enable LZO compression (default).

       nolzo
              Disable LZO compression.

       q=<3-255>
              quality level (default: 255)

       raw
              Disable RTJPEG encoding.

       rtjpeg
              Enable RTJPEG encoding (default).

   xvidenc (-xvidencopts)
       There are three modes available: constant bitrate (CBR), fixed quantiz‐
       er and two pass.

       pass=<1|2>
              Specify the pass in two pass mode.

       turbo (two pass only)
              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and dis‐
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will probably reduce  global
              PSNR  a  little  bit and change individual frame type and PSNR a
              little bit more.

       bitrate=<value> (CBR or two pass mode)
              Sets the bitrate to be used in  kbits/second  if  <16000  or  in
              bits/second  if  >16000.   If <value> is negative, Xvid will use
              its absolute value as the target size (in kBytes) of  the  video
              and  compute  the associated bitrate automagically (default: 687
              kbits/s).

       fixed_quant=<1-31>
              Switch to fixed quantizer mode and specify the quantizer  to  be
              used.

       zones=<zone0>[/<zone1>[/...]] (CBR or two pass mode)
              User  specified  quality  for  specific  parts (ending, credits,
              ...).  Each zone is  <start-frame>,<mode>,<value>  where  <mode>
              may be
                 q    Constant quantizer override, where value=<2.0-31.0> rep‐
                      resents the quantizer value.
                 w    Ratecontrol  weight  override,  where  value=<0.01-2.00>
                      represents the quality correction in %.

              EXAMPLE:
                 zones=90000,q,20
                      Encodes all frames starting with frame 90000 at constant
                      quantizer 20.
                 zones=0,w,0.1/10001,w,1.0/90000,q,20
                      Encode frames 0-10000  at  10%  bitrate,  encode  frames
                      90000 up to the end at constant quantizer 20.  Note that
                      the second zone is needed to delimit the first zone,  as
                      without  it everything up until frame 89999 would be en‐
                      coded at 10% bitrate.

       me_quality=<0-6>
              This option controls the motion estimation subsystem.  The high‐
              er  the  value,  the  more precise the estimation should be (de‐
              fault: 6).  The more precise the motion estimation is, the  more
              bits  can  be  saved.  Precision is gained at the expense of CPU
              time so decrease this setting if you need realtime encoding.

       (no)qpel
              MPEG-4 uses a half pixel precision for its motion search by  de‐
              fault.   The standard proposes a mode where encoders are allowed
              to use quarter pixel precision.  This option usually results  in
              a sharper image.  Unfortunately it has a great impact on bitrate
              and sometimes the higher bitrate use will prevent it from giving
              a better image quality at a fixed bitrate.  It is better to test
              with and without this option and see whether it is  worth  acti‐
              vating.

       (no)gmc
              Enable  Global  Motion  Compensation,  which makes Xvid generate
              special frames (GMC-frames) which are well suited for  Pan/Zoom/
              Rotating  images.   Whether  or  not the use of this option will
              save bits is highly dependent on the source material.

       (no)trellis
              Trellis Quantization is a kind of adaptive  quantization  method
              that saves bits by modifying quantized coefficients to make them
              more compressible by the entropy encoder.  Its impact on quality
              is  good, and if VHQ uses too much CPU for you, this setting can
              be a good alternative to save a few bits (and  gain  quality  at
              fixed bitrate) at a lesser cost than with VHQ (default: on).

       (no)cartoon
              Activate  this if your encoded sequence is an anime/cartoon.  It
              modifies some Xvid internal thresholds so Xvid takes better  de‐
              cisions  on frame types and motion vectors for flat looking car‐
              toons.

       (no)chroma_me
              The usual motion estimation algorithm uses  only  the  luminance
              information  to  find  the best motion vector.  However for some
              video material, using the chroma planes  can  help  find  better
              vectors.   This setting toggles the use of chroma planes for mo‐
              tion estimation (default: on).

       (no)chroma_opt
              Enable a chroma optimizer prefilter.  It will do some extra mag‐
              ic on color information to minimize the stepped-stairs effect on
              edges.  It will improve quality at the cost of  encoding  speed.
              It  reduces PSNR by nature, as the mathematical deviation to the
              original picture will get bigger, but the subjective image qual‐
              ity  will  raise.   Since  it  works with color information, you
              might want to turn it off when encoding in grayscale.

       (no)hq_ac
              Activates high-quality prediction of AC coefficients  for  intra
              frames from neighbor blocks (default: on).

       vhq=<0-4>
              The  motion  search  algorithm is based on a search in the usual
              color domain and tries to find a motion  vector  that  minimizes
              the  difference  between  the  reference  frame  and the encoded
              frame.  With this setting activated, Xvid will also use the fre‐
              quency domain (DCT) to search for a motion vector that minimizes
              not only the spatial difference but also the encoding length  of
              the block.  Fastest to slowest:
                 0    off
                 1    mode decision (inter/intra MB) (default)
                 2    limited search
                 3    medium search
                 4    wide search

       (no)lumi_mask
              Adaptive  quantization  allows the macroblock quantizers to vary
              inside each frame.  This is a ’psychosensory’  setting  that  is
              supposed to make use of the fact that the human eye tends to no‐
              tice fewer details in very bright and very  dark  parts  of  the
              picture.   It  compresses  those areas more strongly than medium
              ones, which will save bits that can  be  spent  again  on  other
              frames, raising overall subjective quality and possibly reducing
              PSNR.

       (no)grayscale
              Make  Xvid  discard  chroma  planes  so  the  encoded  video  is
              grayscale  only.   Note that this does not speed up encoding, it
              just prevents chroma data from being written in the  last  stage
              of encoding.

       (no)interlacing
              Encode  the  fields of interlaced video material.  Turn this op‐
              tion on for interlaced content.
              NOTE: Should you rescale the video, you would need an interlace-
              aware    resizer,    which    you    can   activate   with   -vf
              scale=<width>:<height>:1.

       min_iquant=<0-31>
              minimum I-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_iquant=<0-31>
              maximum I-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_pquant=<0-31>
              minimum P-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_pquant=<0-31>
              maximum P-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_bquant=<0-31>
              minimum B-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_bquant=<0-31>
              maximum B-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_key_interval=<value> (two pass only)
              minimum interval between keyframes (default: 0)

       max_key_interval=<value>
              maximum interval between keyframes (default: 10*fps)

       quant_type=<h263|mpeg>
              Sets the type of quantizer to use.  For high bitrates, you  will
              find  that MPEG quantization preserves more detail.  For low bi‐
              trates, the smoothing of H.263 will give you less  block  noise.
              When using custom matrices, MPEG quantization must be used.

       quant_intra_matrix=<filename>
              Load a custom intra matrix file.  You can build such a file with
              xvid4conf’s matrix editor.

       quant_inter_matrix=<filename>
              Load a custom inter matrix file.  You can build such a file with
              xvid4conf’s matrix editor.

       keyframe_boost=<0-1000> (two pass mode only)
              Shift  some  bits  from  the pool for other frame types to intra
              frames, thus improving keyframe quality.  This amount is an  ex‐
              tra  percentage,  so  a value of 10 will give your keyframes 10%
              more bits than normal (default: 0).

       kfthreshold=<value> (two pass mode only)
              Works together with kfreduction.  Determines  the  minimum  dis‐
              tance  below  which  you consider that two frames are considered
              consecutive and treated  differently  according  to  kfreduction
              (default: 10).

       kfreduction=<0-100> (two pass mode only)
              The  above  two  settings  can  be  used  to  adjust the size of
              keyframes that you consider too close to the first (in  a  row).
              kfthreshold  sets  the range in which keyframes are reduced, and
              kfreduction determines the bitrate reduction they get.  The last
              I-frame will get treated normally (default: 30).

       max_bframes=<0-4>
              Maximum  number  of B-frames to put between I/P-frames (default:
              2).

       bquant_ratio=<0-1000>
              quantizer ratio between B- and non-B-frames, 150=1.50  (default:
              150)

       bquant_offset=<-1000-1000>
              quantizer offset between B- and non-B-frames, 100=1.00 (default:
              100)

       bf_threshold=<-255-255>
              This setting allows you to specify what priority to place on the
              use of B-frames.  The higher the value, the higher the probabil‐
              ity of B-frames being used (default: 0).  Do not forget that  B-
              frames usually have a higher quantizer, and therefore aggressive
              production of B-frames may cause worse visual quality.

       (no)closed_gop
              This option tells Xvid to close every  GOP  (Group  Of  Pictures
              bounded by two I-frames), which makes GOPs independent from each
              other.  This just implies that the last frame of the GOP is  ei‐
              ther  a P-frame or a N-frame but not a B-frame.  It is usually a
              good idea to turn this option on (default: on).

       (no)packed
              This option is meant to solve frame-order issues  when  encoding
              to container formats like AVI that cannot cope with out-of-order
              frames.  In practice, most decoders (both software and hardware)
              are  able  to deal with frame-order themselves, and may get con‐
              fused when this option is turned on, so you can safely leave  if
              off, unless you really know what you are doing.
              WARNING:  This  will generate an illegal bitstream, and will not
              be decodable by ISO-MPEG-4 decoders except DivX/libavcodec/Xvid.
              WARNING: This will also store a fake DivX version in the file so
              the bug autodetection of some decoders might be confused.

       frame_drop_ratio=<0-100> (max_bframes=0 only)
              This setting allows the creation  of  variable  framerate  video
              streams.   The  value of the setting specifies a threshold under
              which, if the difference of the following frame to the  previous
              frame is below or equal to this threshold, a frame gets not cod‐
              ed (a so called n-vop is placed in the  stream).   On  playback,
              when reaching an n-vop the previous frame will be displayed.
              WARNING:  Playing with this setting may result in a jerky video,
              so use it at your own risks!

       rc_reaction_delay_factor=<value>
              This parameter controls the number of frames the CBR  rate  con‐
              troller will wait before reacting to bitrate changes and compen‐
              sating for them to obtain a constant bitrate over  an  averaging
              range of frames.

       rc_averaging_period=<value>
              Real  CBR  is hard to achieve.  Depending on the video material,
              bitrate can be variable, and hard to  predict.   Therefore  Xvid
              uses  an averaging period for which it guarantees a given amount
              of bits (minus a small variation).  This settings expresses  the
              "number  of frames" for which Xvid averages bitrate and tries to
              achieve CBR.

       rc_buffer=<value>
              size of the rate control buffer

       curve_compression_high=<0-100>
              This setting allows Xvid to take a certain  percentage  of  bits
              away  from  high  bitrate  scenes  and give them back to the bit
              reservoir.  You could also use this if you have a clip  with  so
              many  bits allocated to high-bitrate scenes that the low(er)-bi‐
              trate scenes start to look bad (default: 0).

       curve_compression_low=<0-100>
              This setting allows Xvid to give a certain percentage  of  extra
              bits  to  the low bitrate scenes, taking a few bits from the en‐
              tire clip.  This might come in handy if you have a  few  low-bi‐
              trate scenes that are still blocky (default: 0).

       overflow_control_strength=<0-100>
              During  pass one of two pass encoding, a scaled bitrate curve is
              computed.  The difference between that expected  curve  and  the
              result  obtained during encoding is called overflow.  Obviously,
              the two pass rate controller tries to compensate for that  over‐
              flow,  distributing  it over the next frames.  This setting con‐
              trols how much of the overflow is distributed every  time  there
              is  a  new  frame.   Low values allow lazy overflow control, big
              rate bursts are compensated for more slowly (could lead to  lack
              of  precision for small clips).  Higher values will make changes
              in bit redistribution more abrupt, possibly too  abrupt  if  you
              set it too high, creating artifacts (default: 5).
              NOTE:  This setting impacts quality a lot, play with it careful‐
              ly!

       max_overflow_improvement=<0-100>
              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control  may  increase
              the frame size.  This parameter specifies the maximum percentage
              by which the overflow control is allowed to increase  the  frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       max_overflow_degradation=<0-100>
              During  the  frame bit allocation, overflow control may decrease
              the frame size.  This parameter specifies the maximum percentage
              by  which  the overflow control is allowed to decrease the frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       container_frame_overhead=<0...>
              Specifies a frame average overhead per frame, in bytes.  Most of
              the time users express their target bitrate for video w/o taking
              care of the video container overhead.  This small  but  (mostly)
              constant overhead can cause the target file size to be exceeded.
              Xvid allows users to set the amount of overhead  per  frame  the
              container  generates  (give only an average per frame).  0 has a
              special meaning, it lets Xvid use its own  default  values  (de‐
              fault: 24 - AVI average overhead).

       profile=<profile_name>
              Restricts options and VBV (peak bitrate over a short period) ac‐
              cording to the Simple, Advanced Simple and DivX  profiles.   The
              resulting videos should be playable on standalone players adher‐
              ing to these profile specifications.

              NOTE: These profiles should be used in conjunction with  an  ap‐
              propriate -ffourcc.  Generally DX50 is applicable, as some play‐
              ers do not recognize Xvid but most recognize DivX.

       par=<mode>
              Specifies the Pixel Aspect Ratio mode (not to be  confused  with
              DAR,  the  Display Aspect Ratio).  PAR is the ratio of the width
              and height of a single pixel.  So both are  related  like  this:
              DAR = PAR * (width/height).
              MPEG-4  defines 5 pixel aspect ratios and one extended one, giv‐
              ing the opportunity to specify a specific pixel aspect ratio.  5
              standard modes can be specified:
                 vga11
                      It is the usual PAR for PC content.  Pixels are a square
                      unit.
                 pal43
                      PAL standard 4:3 PAR.  Pixels are rectangles.
                 pal169
                      same as above
                 ntsc43
                      same as above
                 ntsc169
                      same as above (Do not forget to give the exact ratio.)
                 ext
                      Allows you to specify your own pixel aspect  ratio  with
                      par_width and par_height.
              NOTE:  In  general,  setting  aspect  and  autoaspect options is
              enough.

       par_width=<1-255> (par=ext only)
              Specifies the width of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       par_height=<1-255> (par=ext only)
              Specifies the height of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       aspect=<x/y | f (float value)>
              Store movie aspect internally, just like MPEG files.  Much nicer
              solution  than  rescaling,  because  quality  is  not decreased.
              MPlayer and a few others players will play these files  correct‐
              ly,  others will display them with the wrong aspect.  The aspect
              parameter can be given as a ratio or a floating point number.

       (no)autoaspect
              Same as the aspect option, but  automatically  computes  aspect,
              taking into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.)
              made in the filter chain.

       psnr
              Print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole  video
              after  encoding  and  store  the per frame PSNR in a file with a
              name like ’psnr_hhmmss.log’ in the current directory.   Returned
              values are in dB (decibel), the higher the better.

       debug
              Save  per-frame  statistics  in ./xvid.dbg. (This is not the two
              pass control file.)


       The following option is only available in Xvid 1.1.x.

       bvhq=<0|1>
              This setting allows vector candidates for B-frames  to  be  used
              for the encoding chosen using a rate distortion optimized opera‐
              tor, which is what is done for P-frames by the vhq option.  This
              produces  nicer-looking  B-frames while incurring almost no per‐
              formance penalty (default: 1).


       The following option is only available in the 1.2.x version of Xvid.

       threads=<0-n>
              Create n threads to run the motion estimation (default: 0).  The
              maximum number of threads that can be used is the picture height
              divided by 16.

   x264enc (-x264encopts)
       bitrate=<value>
              Sets the average bitrate to be used  in  kbits/second  (default:
              off).  Since local bitrate may vary, this average may be inaccu‐
              rate for very short videos (see ratetol).  Constant bitrate  can
              be  achieved  by combining this with vbv_maxrate, at significant
              reduction in quality.

       qp=<0-51>
              This selects the quantizer to use for P-frames.  I- and B-frames
              are  offset  from this value by ip_factor and pb_factor, respec‐
              tively.  20-40 is a useful range.  Lower values result in better
              fidelity,  but higher bitrates.  0 is lossless.  Note that quan‐
              tization in H.264 works  differently  from  MPEG-1/2/4:  H.264’s
              quantization parameter (QP) is on a logarithmic scale.  The map‐
              ping is approximately H264QP = 12 + 6*log2(MPEGQP).   For  exam‐
              ple, MPEG at QP=2 is equivalent to H.264 at QP=18.

       crf=<1.0-50.0>
              Enables  constant  quality  mode,  and selects the quality.  The
              scale is similar to QP.  Like the bitrate-based modes, this  al‐
              lows  each frame to use a different QP based on the frame’s com‐
              plexity.

       pass=<1-3>
              Enable 2 or 3-pass mode.  It is recommended to always encode  in
              2  or  3-pass  mode as it leads to a better bit distribution and
              improves overall quality.
                 1    first pass
                 2    second pass (of two pass encoding)
                 3    Nth pass (second and third passes of three  pass  encod‐
                      ing)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The  first  pass  (pass=1)  collects statistics on the video and
              writes them to a file.  You might want to deactivate  some  CPU-
              hungry options, apart from the ones that are on by default.
              In  two pass mode, the second pass (pass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In three pass mode, the second pass (pass=3, that is not a typo)
              does  both: It first reads the statistics, then overwrites them.
              You can use all encoding options,  except  very  CPU-hungry  op‐
              tions.
              The  third  pass (pass=3) is the same as the second pass, except
              that it has the second pass’ statistics to work from.   You  can
              use all encoding options, including CPU-hungry ones.
              The  first pass may use either average bitrate or constant quan‐
              tizer.  ABR is recommended, since it does not require guessing a
              quantizer.  Subsequent passes are ABR, and must specify bitrate.

       turbo=<0-2>
              Fast first pass mode.  During the first pass of a  two  or  more
              pass  encode  it is possible to gain speed by disabling some op‐
              tions with negligible or even no impact on the final pass output
              quality.
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    Reduce  subq, frameref and disable some inter-macroblock
                      partition analysis modes.
                 2    Reduce subq and frameref to 1, use a diamond  ME  search
                      and disable all partition analysis modes.
              Level 1 can increase first pass speed up to 2x with no change in
              the global PSNR of the final pass compared  to  a  full  quality
              first pass.
              Level  2  can  increase first pass speed up to 4x with about +/-
              0.05dB change in the global PSNR of the final pass compared to a
              full quality first pass.

       keyint=<value>
              Sets maximum interval between IDR-frames (default: 250).  Larger
              values save bits, thus improve quality, at the cost  of  seeking
              precision.   Unlike  MPEG-1/2/4,  H.264 does not suffer from DCT
              drift with large values of keyint.

       keyint_min=<1-keyint/2>
              Sets minimum interval  between  IDR-frames  (default:  25).   If
              scenecuts appear within this interval, they are still encoded as
              I-frames, but do not start a new GOP.  In H.264, I-frames do not
              necessarily  bound a closed GOP because it is allowable for a P-
              frame to be predicted from more frames than just the  one  frame
              before it (also see frameref).  Therefore, I-frames are not nec‐
              essarily seekable.  IDR-frames restrict subsequent P-frames from
              referring to any frame prior to the IDR-frame.

       scenecut=<-1-100>
              Controls  how  aggressively  to  insert extra I-frames (default:
              40).  With small values of scenecut,  the  codec  often  has  to
              force  an  I-frame  when it would exceed keyint.  Good values of
              scenecut may find a better location for the I-frame.  Large val‐
              ues  use  more  I-frames  than necessary, thus wasting bits.  -1
              disables scene-cut detection, so I-frames are inserted only once
              every  other  keyint frames, even if a scene-cut occurs earlier.
              This is not recommended and wastes bitrate as scenecuts  encoded
              as  P-frames  are  just as big as I-frames, but do not reset the
              "keyint counter".

       frameref=<1-16>
              Number of previous frames used as predictors in B- and  P-frames
              (default:  1).   This  is effective in anime, but in live-action
              material the improvements usually drop off very rapidly above  6
              or  so  reference frames.  This has no effect on decoding speed,
              but does increase the memory needed for decoding.  Some decoders
              can only handle a maximum of 15 reference frames.

       bframes=<0-16>
              maximum  number  of consecutive B-frames between I- and P-frames
              (default: 0)

       (no)b_adapt
              Automatically decides when to use B-frames and how many,  up  to
              the  maximum  specified  above (default: on).  If this option is
              disabled, then the maximum number of B-frames is used.

       b_bias=<-100-100>
              Controls the decision performed by  b_adapt.   A  higher  b_bias
              produces more B-frames (default: 0).

       (no)b_pyramid
              Allows  B-frames  to  be used as references for predicting other
              frames.  For example, consider 3 consecutive B-frames: I0 B1  B2
              B3 P4.  Without this option, B-frames follow the same pattern as
              MPEG-[124].  So they are coded in the order I0 P4 B1 B2 B3,  and
              all  the  B-frames  are predicted from I0 and P4.  With this op‐
              tion, they are coded as I0 P4 B2 B1  B3.   B2  is  the  same  as
              above,  but  B1 is predicted from I0 and B2, and B3 is predicted
              from B2 and P4.  This usually results in slightly improved  com‐
              pression,  at almost no speed cost.  However, this is an experi‐
              mental option: it is not fully tuned and may  not  always  help.
              Requires  bframes  >= 2.  Disadvantage: increases decoding delay
              to 2 frames.

       (no)deblock
              Use deblocking filter (default: on).  As it  takes  very  little
              time compared to its quality gain, it is not recommended to dis‐
              able it.

       deblock=<-6-6>,<-6-6>
              The first parameter  is  AlphaC0  (default:  0).   This  adjusts
              thresholds for the H.264 in-loop deblocking filter.  First, this
              parameter adjusts the maximum amount of change that  the  filter
              is  allowed to cause on any one pixel.  Secondly, this parameter
              affects the threshold for difference across the edge being  fil‐
              tered.   A  positive  value reduces blocking artifacts more, but
              will also smear details.
              The second parameter is Beta (default: 0).  This affects the de‐
              tail  threshold.   Very  detailed blocks are not filtered, since
              the smoothing caused by the filter would be more noticeable than
              the original blocking.
              The  default behavior of the filter almost always achieves opti‐
              mal quality, so it is best to either leave it alone, or make on‐
              ly  small adjustments.  However, if your source material already
              has some blocking or noise which you would like  to  remove,  it
              may be a good idea to turn it up a little bit.

       (no)cabac
              Use  CABAC (Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding) (default:
              on).  Slightly slows down encoding and decoding, but should save
              10-15%  bitrate.  Unless you are looking for decoding speed, you
              should not disable it.

       qp_min=<1-51> (ABR or two pass)
              Minimum quantizer, 10-30 seems to be a  useful  range  (default:
              10).

       qp_max=<1-51> (ABR or two pass)
              maximum quantizer (default: 51)

       qp_step=<1-50> (ABR or two pass)
              maximum  value  by which the quantizer may be incremented/decre‐
              mented between frames (default: 4)

       ratetol=<0.1-100.0> (ABR or two pass)
              allowed variance in average bitrate (no particular  units)  (de‐
              fault: 1.0)

       vbv_maxrate=<value> (ABR or two pass)
              maximum local bitrate, in kbits/second (default: disabled)

       vbv_bufsize=<value> (ABR or two pass)
              averaging  period for vbv_maxrate, in kbits (default: none, must
              be specified if vbv_maxrate is enabled)

       vbv_init=<0.0-1.0> (ABR or two pass)
              initial buffer occupancy, as a fraction of vbv_bufsize (default:
              0.9)

       ip_factor=<value>
              quantizer factor between I- and P-frames (default: 1.4)

       pb_factor=<value>
              quantizer factor between P- and B-frames (default: 1.3)

       qcomp=<0-1> (ABR or two pass)
              quantizer  compression  (default: 0.6).  A lower value makes the
              bitrate more constant, while a higher value makes the  quantiza‐
              tion parameter more constant.

       cplx_blur=<0-999> (two pass only)
              Temporal  blur  of  the estimated frame complexity, before curve
              compression (default: 20).  Lower  values  allow  the  quantizer
              value  to  jump around more, higher values force it to vary more
              smoothly.  cplx_blur ensures that each I-frame has quality  com‐
              parable  to the following P-frames, and ensures that alternating
              high and low complexity frames (e.g. low fps animation)  do  not
              waste bits on fluctuating quantizer.

       qblur=<0-99> (two pass only)
              Temporal  blur  of  the quantization parameter, after curve com‐
              pression (default: 0.5).  Lower values allow the quantizer value
              to jump around more, higher values force it to vary more smooth‐
              ly.

       zones=<zone0>[/<zone1>[/...]]
              User specified quality  for  specific  parts  (ending,  credits,
              ...).  Each zone is <start-frame>,<end-frame>,<option> where op‐
              tion may be
                 q=<0-51>
                      quantizer
                 b=<0.01-100.0>
                      bitrate multiplier
              NOTE: The quantizer option is not strictly enforced.  It affects
              only  the planning stage of ratecontrol, and is still subject to
              overflow compensation and qp_min/qp_max.

       direct_pred=<name>
              Determines the type of motion prediction used  for  direct  mac‐
              roblocks in B-frames.
                 none Direct macroblocks are not used.
                 spatial
                      Motion vectors are extrapolated from neighboring blocks.
                      (default)
                 temporal
                      Motion vectors are interpolated from  the  following  P-
                      frame.
                 auto The  codec selects between spatial and temporal for each
                      frame.
              Spatial and temporal are approximately the same speed and  PSNR,
              the  choice  between them depends on the video content.  Auto is
              slightly better, but slower.  Auto is most effective  when  com‐
              bined with multipass.  direct_pred=none is both slower and lower
              quality.

       (no)weight_b
              Use weighted prediction in B-frames.  Without this option, bidi‐
              rectionally predicted macroblocks give equal weight to each ref‐
              erence frame.  With this option, the weights are  determined  by
              the temporal position of the B-frame relative to the references.
              Requires bframes > 1.

       partitions=<list>
              Enable    some    optional    macroblock     types     (default:
              p8x8,b8x8,i8x8,i4x4).
                 p8x8 Enable types p16x8, p8x16, p8x8.
                 p4x4 Enable types p8x4, p4x8, p4x4.  p4x4 is recommended only
                      with subq >= 5, and only at low resolutions.
                 b8x8 Enable types b16x8, b8x16, b8x8.
                 i8x8 Enable type i8x8.  i8x8 has no effect unless  8x8dct  is
                      enabled.
                 i4x4 Enable type i4x4.
                 all  Enable all of the above types.
                 none Disable all of the above types.
              Regardless  of this option, macroblock types p16x16, b16x16, and
              i16x16 are always enabled.
              The idea is to find the type and size that best describe a  cer‐
              tain  area  of the picture.  For example, a global pan is better
              represented by 16x16 blocks, while small moving objects are bet‐
              ter represented by smaller blocks.

       (no)8x8dct
              Adaptive  spatial  transform  size: allows macroblocks to choose
              between 4x4 and 8x8 DCT.  Also allows the i8x8 macroblock  type.
              Without this option, only 4x4 DCT is used.

       me=<name>
              Select fullpixel motion estimation algorithm.
                 dia  diamond search, radius 1 (fast)
                 hex  hexagon search, radius 2 (default)
                 umh  uneven multi-hexagon search (slow)
                 esa  exhaustive search (very slow, and no better than umh)

       me_range=<4-64>
              radius  of  exhaustive  or multi-hexagon motion search (default:
              16)

       subq=<1-7>
              Adjust subpel refinement quality.  This parameter controls qual‐
              ity versus speed tradeoffs involved in the motion estimation de‐
              cision process.  subq=5 can  compress  up  to  10%  better  than
              subq=1.
                 1    Runs fullpixel precision motion estimation on all candi‐
                      date macroblock types.   Then  selects  the  best  type.
                      Then refines the motion of that type to fast quarterpix‐
                      el precision (fastest).
                 2    Runs halfpixel precision motion estimation on all candi‐
                      date  macroblock  types.   Then  selects  the best type.
                      Then refines the motion of that type to fast quarterpix‐
                      el precision.
                 3    As 2, but uses a slower quarterpixel refinement.
                 4    Runs  fast  quarterpixel  precision motion estimation on
                      all candidate macroblock types.  Then selects  the  best
                      type.   Then  finishes  the  quarterpixel refinement for
                      that type.
                 5    Runs best quality quarterpixel precision motion  estima‐
                      tion on all candidate macroblock types, before selecting
                      the best type (default).
                 6    Enables rate-distortion optimization of macroblock types
                      in I- and P-frames.
                 7    Enables  rate-distortion  optimization of motion vectors
                      and intra modes. (best)
              In the above, "all candidates" does not exactly mean all enabled
              types: 4x4, 4x8, 8x4 are tried only if 8x8 is better than 16x16.

       (no)chroma_me
              Takes into account chroma  information  during  subpixel  motion
              search (default: enabled).  Requires subq>=5.

       (no)mixed_refs
              Allows each 8x8 or 16x8 motion partition to independently select
              a reference frame.  Without this option, a whole macroblock must
              use the same reference.  Requires frameref>1.

       (no)brdo
              Enables  rate-distortion  optimization of macroblock types in B-
              frames.  Requires subq>=6.

       (no)bime
              Refine the two motion vectors used in bidirectional macroblocks,
              rather  than  re-using  vectors  from  the  forward and backward
              searches.  This option has no effect without B-frames.

       trellis=<0-2>
              rate-distortion optimal quantization
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    enabled only for the final encode
                 2    enabled  during  all  mode  decisions  (slow,   requires
                      subq>=6)

       deadzone_inter=<0-32>
              Set  the  size  of the inter luma quantization deadzone for non-
              trellis quantization (default: 21).  Lower values help  to  pre‐
              serve fine details and film grain (typically useful for high bi‐
              trate/quality encode), while higher values help filter out these
              details  to  save  bits  that  can  be spent again on other mac‐
              roblocks and frames (typically useful  for  bitrate-starved  en‐
              codes).   It  is  recommended  that  you start by tweaking dead‐
              zone_intra before changing this parameter.

       deadzone_intra=<0-32>
              Set the size of the intra luma quantization  deadzone  for  non-
              trellis  quantization  (default:  11).  This option has the same
              effect as deadzone_inter except that it  affects  intra  frames.
              It  is recommended that you start by tweaking this parameter be‐
              fore changing deadzone_inter.

       (no)fast_pskip
              Performs early skip detection in  P-frames  (default:  enabled).
              This  usually  improves  speed  at no cost, but it can sometimes
              produce artifacts in areas with no details, like sky.

       (no)dct_decimate
              Eliminate dct blocks in P-frames containing only a small  single
              coefficient  (default: enabled).  This will remove some details,
              so it will save bits that can be spent again  on  other  frames,
              hopefully  raising  overall subjective quality.  If you are com‐
              pressing non-anime content with a high target bitrate,  you  may
              want to disable this to preserve as much detail as possible.

       nr=<0-100000>
              Noise  reduction,  0 means disabled.  100-1000 is a useful range
              for typical content, but you may want to turn it up a  bit  more
              for  very noisy content (default: 0).  Given its small impact on
              speed, you might want to prefer to use this over filtering noise
              away with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

       chroma_qp_offset=<-12-12>
              Use  a different quantizer for chroma as compared to luma.  Use‐
              ful values are in the range <-2-2> (default: 0).

       cqm=<flat|jvt|<filename>>
              Either uses a predefined custom quantization matrix or  loads  a
              JM format matrix file.
                 flat
                      Use the predefined flat 16 matrix (default).
                 jvt
                      Use the predefined JVT matrix.
                 <filename>
                      Use the provided JM format matrix file.
              NOTE: Windows CMD.EXE users may experience problems with parsing
              the command line if they attempt to use all the CQM lists.  This
              is  due to a command line length limitation.  In this case it is
              recommended the lists be put into a JM format CQM file and load‐
              ed as specified above.

       cqm4iy=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom  4x4  intra luminance matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4ic=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 intra chrominance matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4py=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom  4x4  inter luminance matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4pc=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 inter chrominance matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm8iy=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom  8x8  intra luminance matrix, given as a list of 64 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm8py=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 8x8 inter luminance matrix, given as a list of  64  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       level_idc=<10-51>
              Set  the  bitstream’s  level  as defined by annex A of the H.264
              standard (default: 51 - Level 5.1).  This is  used  for  telling
              the decoder what capabilities it needs to support.  Use this pa‐
              rameter only if you know what it means, and you have a  need  to
              set it.

       threads=<0-16>
              Spawn  threads  to encode in parallel on multiple CPUs (default:
              1).  This has a slight penalty to  compression  quality.   0  or
              ’auto’  tells  x264 to detect how many CPUs you have and pick an
              appropriate number of threads.

       (no)global_header
              Causes SPS and PPS to appear only once, at the beginning of  the
              bitstream  (default:  disabled).  Some players, such as the Sony
              PSP, require the use of this option.  The default behavior caus‐
              es SPS and PPS to repeat prior to each IDR frame.

       (no)interlaced
              Treat the video content as interlaced.

       log=<-1-3>
              Adjust the amount of logging info printed to the screen.
                 -1   none
                  0   Print errors only.
                  1   warnings
                  2   PSNR  and other analysis statistics when the encode fin‐
                      ishes (default)
                  3   PSNR, QP, frametype, size, and other statistics for  ev‐
                      ery frame

       (no)psnr
              Print signal-to-noise ratio statistics.
              NOTE:  The  ’Y’,  ’U’, ’V’, and ’Avg’ PSNR fields in the summary
              are not mathematically sound (they are  simply  the  average  of
              per-frame  PSNRs).   They are kept only for comparison to the JM
              reference codec.  For all other purposes, please use either  the
              ’Global’ PSNR, or the per-frame PSNRs printed by log=3.

       (no)ssim
              Print  the Structural Similarity Metric results.  This is an al‐
              ternative to PSNR, and may be better correlated  with  the  per‐
              ceived quality of the compressed video.

       (no)visualize
              Enable x264 visualizations during encoding.  If the x264 on your
              system supports it, a new window will be opened during  the  en‐
              coding  process,  in  which  x264  will  attempt  to  present an
              overview of how each frame gets encoded.  Each block type on the
              visualized movie will be colored as follows:
                 red/pink
                      intra block
                 blue
                      inter block
                 green
                      skip block
                 yellow
                      B-block
              This  feature  can  be  considered  experimental  and subject to
              change.  In particular, it depends on x264 being  compiled  with
              visualizations  enabled.   Note  that  as  of writing this, x264
              pauses after encoding and visualizing each  frame,  waiting  for
              the  user  to press a key, at which point the next frame will be
              encoded.

   xvfw (-xvfwopts)
       Encoding with Video for Windows codecs is mostly  obsolete  unless  you
       wish to encode to some obscure fringe codec.

       codec=<name>
              The name of the binary codec file with which to encode.

       compdata=<file>
              The name of the codec settings file (like firstpass.mcf) created
              by vfw2menc.

   MPEG muxer (-mpegopts)
       The MPEG muxer can generate 5 types of streams, each of which has  rea‐
       sonable default parameters that the user can override.  Generally, when
       generating MPEG files, it is advisable to disable MEncoder’s frame-skip
       code  (see  -noskip, -mc as well as the harddup and softskip video fil‐
       ters).

       EXAMPLE:
                 format=mpeg2:tsaf:vbitrate=8000

       format=<mpeg1 | mpeg2 | xvcd | xsvcd | dvd | pes1 | pes2>
              stream format (default: mpeg2).  pes1 and pes2 are  very  broken
              formats  (no  pack header and no padding), but VDR uses them; do
              not choose them unless you know exactly what you are doing.

       size=<up to 65535>
              Pack size in bytes, do not change unless you know  exactly  what
              you are doing (default: 2048).

       muxrate=<int>
              Nominal  muxrate  in  kbit/s  used in the pack headers (default:
              1800 kb/s).  Will be updated as necessary in the case  of  ’for‐
              mat=mpeg1’ or ’mpeg2’.

       tsaf
              Sets  timestamps  on  all  frames, if possible; recommended when
              format=dvd.  If dvdauthor complains with a message like "..audio
              sector  out  of  range...", you probably did not enable this op‐
              tion.

       interleaving2
              Uses a better algorithm to interleave audio and  video  packets,
              based  on  the  principle that the muxer will always try to fill
              the stream with the largest percentage of free space.

       vdelay=<1-32760>
              Initial video delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0),  use  it
              if  you  want  to delay video with respect to audio.  It doesn’t
              work with :drop.

       adelay=<1-32760>
              Initial audio delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0),  use  it
              if you want to delay audio with respect to video.

       drop
              When used with vdelay the muxer drops the part of audio that was
              anticipated.

       vwidth, vheight=<1-4095>
              Set the video width and height when video is MPEG-1/2.

       vpswidth, vpsheight=<1-4095>
              Set pan and scan video width and height when video is MPEG-2.

       vaspect=<1 | 4/3 | 16/9 | 221/100>
              Sets the display aspect ratio for MPEG-2 video.  Do not  use  it
              on  MPEG-1  or  the  resulting  aspect  ratio will be completely
              wrong.

       vbitrate=<int>
              Sets the video bitrate in kbit/s for MPEG-1/2 video.

       vframerate=<24000/1001 | 24 | 25 | 30000/1001 | 30 | 50 | 60000/1001  |
       60 >
              Sets the framerate for MPEG-1/2 video.  This option will be  ig‐
              nored if used with the telecine option.

       telecine
              Enables 3:2 pulldown soft telecine mode: The muxer will make the
              video stream look like it was encoded at 30000/1001 fps.  It on‐
              ly  works  with  MPEG-2  video  when  the  output  framerate  is
              24000/1001 fps, convert it with -ofps if necessary.   Any  other
              framerate is incompatible with this option.

       film2pal
              Enables FILM to PAL and NTSC to PAL soft telecine mode: The mux‐
              er will make the video stream look like it  was  encoded  at  25
              fps.   It only works with MPEG-2 video when the output framerate
              is 24000/1001 fps, convert it with -ofps if necessary.  Any oth‐
              er framerate is incompatible with this option.

       tele_src and tele_dest
              Enables  arbitrary  telecining  using  Donand Graft’s DGPulldown
              code.  You need to specify the original and the desired  framer‐
              ate;  the  muxer will make the video stream look like it was en‐
              coded at the desired framerate.  It only works with MPEG-2 video
              when  the  input  framerate is smaller than the output framerate
              and the framerate increase is <= 1.5.

              EXAMPLE:
                 tele_src=25,tele_dest=30000/1001
                      PAL to NTSC telecining

       vbuf_size=<40-1194>
              Sets the size of the video decoder’s buffer, expressed in  kilo‐
              bytes.   Specify  it  only if the bitrate of the video stream is
              too high for the chosen format and if you  know  perfectly  well
              what  you are doing.  A too high value may lead to an unplayable
              movie, depending on the player’s capabilities.  When muxing HDTV
              video a value of 400 should suffice.

       abuf_size=<4-64>
              Sets  the size of the audio decoder’s buffer, expressed in kilo‐
              bytes.  The same principle as for vbuf_size applies.

   FFmpeg libavformat demuxers (-lavfdopts)
       probesize=<value>
              Maximum amount of data to probe during the detection phase.   In
              the  case of MPEG-TS this value identifies the maximum number of
              TS packets to scan.

   FFmpeg libavformat muxers (-lavfopts) (also see -of lavf)
       delay=<value>
              Currently only meaningful for  MPEG[12]:  Maximum  allowed  dis‐
              tance,  in  seconds,  between  the reference timer of the output
              stream (SCR) and the decoding timestamp  (DTS)  for  any  stream
              present (demux to decode delay).  Default is 0.7 (as mandated by
              the standards defined by MPEG).  Higher  values  require  larger
              buffers and must not be used.

       format=<container_format>
              Override which container format to mux into (default: autodetect
              from output file extension).

       i_certify_that_my_video_stream_does_not_use_b_frames
              MEncoder cannot assign correct  timestamps  when  there  are  B-
              frames in the video stream, resulting in broken encodes.  If you
              wish to use the lavf muxer, you must not let the video codec use
              B-frames  (see the relevant documentation of each codec) and you
              also must specify this option.

       muxrate=<rate>
              Nominal bitrate of the multiplex, in bits per second;  currently
              it  is  meaningful  only  for MPEG[12].  Sometimes raising it is
              necessary in order to avoid "buffer underflows".

       packetsize=<size>
              Size, expressed in bytes, of the unitary packet for  the  chosen
              format.   When  muxing  to  MPEG[12] implementations the default
              values are: 2324 for [S]VCD, 2048 for all others formats.

       preload=<distance>
              Currently only meaningful for  MPEG[12]:  Initial  distance,  in
              seconds,  between the reference timer of the output stream (SCR)
              and the decoding timestamp (DTS) for any stream  present  (demux
              to decode delay).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control
       the behavior of MPlayer and MEncoder.

       MPLAYER_CHARSET (also see -msgcharset)
              Convert console messages to the specified charset (default:  au‐
              todetect).  A value of "noconv" means no conversion.

       MPLAYER_HOME
              Directory where MPlayer looks for user settings.

       MPLAYER_VERBOSE (also see -v and -msglevel)
              Set  the initial verbosity level across all message modules (de‐
              fault: 0).  Negative values result in fewer messages while posi‐
              tive values result in more.

   libaf:
       LADSPA_PATH
              If  LADSPA_PATH  is set, it searches for the specified file.  If
              it is not set, you  must  supply  a  fully  specified  pathname.
              FIXME: This is also mentioned in the ladspa section.

   libdvdcss:
       DVDCSS_CACHE
              Specify  a  directory  in which to store title key values.  This
              will speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache.   The
              DVDCSS_CACHE  directory  is  created if it does not exist, and a
              subdirectory is created named after the DVD’s title or  manufac‐
              turing  date.  If DVDCSS_CACHE is not set or is empty, libdvdcss
              will use the default value  which  is  "${HOME}/.dvdcss/"  under
              Unix and "C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application Data\dvdc‐
              ss\" under Win32.  The special value "off" disables caching.

       DVDCSS_METHOD
              Sets the authentication and  decryption  method  that  libdvdcss
              will  use  to read scrambled discs.  Can be one of title, key or
              disc.
                 key
                      is the default method.  libdvdcss will use a set of cal‐
                      culated  player  keys to try and get the disc key.  This
                      can fail if the drive does  not  recognize  any  of  the
                      player keys.
                 disc
                      is  a  fallback  method when key has failed.  Instead of
                      using player keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key us‐
                      ing a brute force algorithm.  This process is CPU inten‐
                      sive and requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary da‐
                      ta.
                 title
                      is  the fallback when all other methods have failed.  It
                      does not rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive,  but
                      rather  uses a crypto attack to guess the title key.  On
                      rare cases this may fail because there is not enough en‐
                      crypted  data  on  the disc to perform a statistical at‐
                      tack, but in the other hand it is the only  way  to  de‐
                      crypt  a  DVD  stored  on a hard disc, or a DVD with the
                      wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

       DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE
              Specify the raw device to use.  Exact usage will depend on  your
              operating  system,  the  Linux  utility to set up raw devices is
              raw(8) for instance.  Please note that on  most  operating  sys‐
              tems,  using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux
              requires a 2048 bytes alignment (which is the size of a DVD sec‐
              tor).

       DVDCSS_VERBOSE
              Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.
                 0    Outputs no messages at all.
                 1    Outputs error messages to stderr.
                 2    Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.

       DVDREAD_NOKEYS
              Skip retrieving all keys on startup.  Currently disabled.

              FIXME: Document this.

       AUDIODEV
              FIXME: Document this.

       AUDIOSERVER
              Specifies the Network Audio System server to which the nas audio
              output driver should connect and the transport  that  should  be
              used.   If  unset DISPLAY is used instead.  The transport can be
              one of  tcp  and  unix.   Syntax  is  tcp/<somehost>:<someport>,
              <somehost>:<instancenumber> or [unix]:<instancenumber>.  The NAS
              base port is 8000 and <instancenumber> is added to that.

              EXAMPLES:
                 AUDIOSERVER=somehost:0
                      Connect to NAS server on somehost using default port and
                      transport.
                 AUDIOSERVER=tcp/somehost:8000
                      Connect  to NAS server on somehost listening on TCP port
                      8000.
                 AUDIOSERVER=(unix)?:0
                      Connect to NAS server instance 0 on localhost using unix
                      domain sockets.

EXAMPLES OF MPLAYER USAGE
       Quickstart DVD playing:
       mplayer dvd://1

       Play in Japanese with English subtitles:
       mplayer dvd://1 -alang ja -slang en

       Play only chapters 5, 6, 7:
       mplayer dvd://1 -chapter 5-7

       Play only titles 5, 6, 7:
       mplayer dvd://5-7

       Play a multiangle DVD:
       mplayer dvd://1 -dvdangle 2

       Play from a different DVD device:
       mplayer dvd://1 -dvd-device /dev/dvd2

       Play DVD video from a directory with VOB files:
       mplayer dvd://1 -dvd-device /path/to/directory/

       Copy a DVD title to hard disk, saving to file title1.vob :
       mplayer dvd://1 -dumpstream -dumpfile title1.vob

       Stream from HTTP:
       mplayer http://mplayer.hq/example.avi

       Stream using RTSP:
       mplayer rtsp://server.example.com/streamName

       Convert subtitles to MPsub format:
       mplayer dummy.avi -sub source.sub -dumpmpsub

       Convert subtitles to MPsub format without watching the movie:
       mplayer /dev/zero -rawvideo pal:fps=xx -demuxer rawvideo -vc null -vo null -noframedrop -benchmark -sub source.sub -dumpmpsub

       input from standard V4L:
       mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l:width=640:height=480:outfmt=i420 -vc rawi420 -vo xv

       Playback on Zoran cards (old style, deprecated):
       mplayer -vo zr -vf scale=352:288 file.avi

       Playback on Zoran cards (new style):
       mplayer -vo zr2 -vf scale=352:288,zrmjpeg file.avi

       You might want to play a bit with the pan values (e.g multiply  with  a
       value) to increase volume or avoid clipping.

       checkerboard invert with geq filter:
       mplayer -vf geq=’128+(p(XY)-128)*(0.5-gt(mod(X/SW128)64))*(0.5-gt(mod(Y/SH128)64))*4’
